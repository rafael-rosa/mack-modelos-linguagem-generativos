267,"THE STORY OF PERDIDA IS INTERESTING ENOUGH. IN MORE SKILLED HANDS IT COULD HAVE BECOME A CLASSIC MEXICAN MELODRAMA, BUT THE FILM SOMETIMES PLODS ALONG AND THE STORY LOSES SOME OF ITS EFFECTIVENESS. IN FILMS LIKE ""VICTIMAS DEL PECADO"" AND ""AVENTURERA"" (BOTH FEATURING NIÑON SEVILLA), THE MUSICAL NUMBERS MIX EFFORTLESSLY WITH THE PLOT. FERNANDO RIVERO, THE DIRECTOR, IS SOMETIMES HEAVY-HANDED - SOME SCENES DRAG A BIT TOO MUCH, BUT ALL IN ALL, IT IS STILL FUN TO SEE THE FILM - NIÑON SEVILLA AND THE MUSICAL NUMBERS TAKE CHARGE OF THAT.THE STORY IS TRADITIONAL ENOUGH. IT TALKS ABOUT A NAIVE COUNTRY GIRL WHO IS RAPED BY HER STEPFATHER, RUNS AWAY AND GOES TO THE BIG CITY, LOOKING FOR A JOB. NEEDLESS TO SAY, SHE ENDS UP IN A BROTHEL AND ALL KINDS OF MISFORTUNES BEFALL THE POOR GIRL. I THINK THAT I'M NOT SPOILING ANYTHING BECAUSE THIS IS A TRADITIONAL STORY LINE THAT MANY MEXICAN FILMS FOLLOWED AT THE TIME.THERE IS ONE SCENE IN PARTICULAR THAT I LIKE A LOT: NIÑON SEVILLA IS SITTING SADLY ON AN ARMCHAIR IN THE BROTHEL WHERE SHE HAD BEEN TRAPPED, AND THE TRIO ""LOS PANCHOS"" DESCENDS SLOWLY THE STAIRCASE WITH THEIR GUITARS SINGING ""PERDIDA"" (PERDIDA COULD BE TRANSLATED IN ENGLISH AS ""FALLEN WOMAN"". THEY STOP IN FRONT OF HER, ALWAYS SINGING, AND WHENEVER THEY SING THE REFRAIN PERDIDA (FALLEN WOMAN) THE CAMERA SHOWS NIÑON SEVILLA'S FACE BATHED IN TEARS. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE! BUT YOU HAVE TO THINK THAT SCENES LIKE THAT MADE MANY PEOPLE CRY IN THE MOVIE THEATER AT THE TIME. IN ONE OF HER MUSICAL PERFORMANCES, NIÑON SEVILLA (DRESSED AS CARMEN MIRANDA), WITH THE ANJOS DO INFERNO AS BACKING GROUP, SINGS ""NEGO"" IN PORTUGUESE - HER SPANISH ACCENT IS VERY SEXY!UNFORTUNATELY FERNANDO RIVERO HASN'T GOT THE HANDICRAFT ABILITY OF ALBERTO GOUT, OR THE MELODRAMATIC POETRY OF EMILIO FERNANDEZ.

340,"MY NOMINEE FOR CARLOS TOBALINA'S WORST FILM (A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE RACE TO BE SURE) IS MAI LIN VS. SERENA, WHICH I SUFFERED THROUGH INSIDE A TIMES SQUARE ADULT THEATER BACK IN THE '80S AND FELT WAS THE WORST MOVIE I'D SEEN UP UNTIL THAT TIME. BUT FOR SHEER LAZINESS AND SLOPPINESS, FANTASTIC ORGY HAS TO QUALIFY FOR CONSIDERATION IN CT'S RACE TO THE BOTTOM.IT IS ESSENTIALLY AN HOUR-PLUS OF RECYCLED FOOTAGE, NOT HIGHLIGHTS BUT RANDOM JUNK FROM CT'S VAULTS. IT IS STRUCTURED (IF I CAN ABUSE THAT WORD) AS A TRIBUTE TO CARLOS'S AFFIRMATIVE ACTION RECIPIENT IRIS MEDINA, AN UNATTRACTIVE AND UNTALENTED PERFORMER WE SEE AS EXTRA (SITTING AROUND AT ORGIES) OR ACTIVE XXX PARTICIPANT (GET THE HOOK!).THERE IS A MODICUM OF NEW FOOTAGE, AS HOSTESS ""MARTHA SHARP"" INTRODUCES US TO IRIS, AND MANAGES TO CALL HER IRENE A FEW SECONDS LATER -NO RETAKES, FLUB LEFT IN FINISHED 35MM FILM. MEDINA SPEAKS HALTINGLY A FEW WORDS IN HEAVILY ACCENTED ENGLISH, THEN TAKES OVER AS VOICE- OVER NARRATOR SPOKEN BY SOMEONE ELSE WITHOUT A TRACE OF ACCENT, BUT FORCED TO RECITE ENDLESS GIBBERISH UNDOUBTEDLY PENNED BY TOBALINA. THE NARRATOR'S COMMENTS ABOUT ""HERSELF"" RING ABOUT AS TRUE AS WHAT THE OLD MEN'S MAGAZINES OF THE '50S AND '60S USED TO CALL ""SEMI-FICTION"": THE BLURBS ABOUT MODELS (THEIR BIO, LIKES &AMP; DISLIKES) APPEARING IN PHOTO SPREADS, OR PERHAPS THE SOAP OPERA ARCS OF VINCE MCMAHON'S WWF BECAME WWE RASSLING ORGANIZATION.BUT THE FAKE LOQUACIOUS VOICE-OVER IRIS LIKES TO PRAISE OTHERS, NATURALLY HER PRODUCER TOBALINA (THE ONLY GUY WHO EVER HIRED HER FOR A MOVIE), AND HER FAVORITE STARS ANNETTE HAVEN, JOHN HOLMES AND SHARON THORPE. SHE RAMBLES ON ABOUT HAVEN OVER AND OVER BUT ONLY LATER IN THE COMPILATION DO WE GET TO ACTUALLY SEE A VERY YOUNG ANNETTE IN A CUTTING-ROOM-FLOOR WORTHY THREE-WAY SEGMENT.MAN OF HER DREAMS HOLMES SHOWS UP TO END THE FILM IN WHAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE NEWLY SHOT FOOTAGE - ROUTINELY HUMPING IRIS AND ""THE END"" MERCIFULLY SUPERIMPOSED ON SCREEN ARBITRARILY AFTER HE UNLOADS HIS WADD ON HER BELLY. THE MAIN DISCUSSION OF THORPE ACCOMPANIES A SCENE FOCUSING ON A DIFFERENT ACTRESS ALTOGETHER.THE ENDLESS CLIPS ARE MAINLY ORGIES, FOR WHICH THE NARRATOR REVEALS TOBALINA'S PHILOSOPHY AND IN MY MIND HIS UNDOING, AS SHE ASSERTS ""ORGIES ARE ALWAYS A TURN-ON FOR AUDIENCES"". CT IS FOND OF MAKING CLAIMS WITH NO RESEARCH BACKING THEM UP, AND MOVIE ORGY SEQUENCES, ESPECIALLY HIS, ARE GENERALLY SHOW-STOPPERS IN THE WORST SENSE OF THAT TERM: THEY CAUSE THE FILM TO GRIND TO A HALT AND ARE NEVER AS STIMULATING AS A TORRID PAIRING OR THREE-WAY. HER NARRATION IS OFTEN BEYOND STUPID, AS IN LINES LIKE: ""THEY LOVE TO PERPETRATE THEIR LOVE AND PASSION"", REFERRING TO (ANOTHER IDIOTIC CLAIM) ADULT FILM TALENT APPEARING ON SCREEN IN AN ALTRUISTIC SENSE OF WANTING TO PLEASE PEOPLE, NOT FOR THE MONEY. THIS, LIKE THE USUAL TELL-TALE DEFENSIVENESS OF ""PORN ACTORS ARE NOT PROSTITUTES"" (SHE EVEN CLAIMS THEY ARE AS GOOD A SET OF ACTORS AS MAINSTREAM THESPIANS) IS TIRESOME B.S. PROPAGANDA SIMILAR TO THE STILL-IN-CIRCULATION ON VIDEO INTROS THAT CLOAK PORNOGRAPHY UNDER THE ""FREE-SPEECH ACTIVISTS"" UMBRELLA. I'M WAITING TO HEAR WHAT FUTURE PRESIDENT RAND PAUL HAS TO SAY ON THE SUBJECT, GIVEN HIS EXTREME LIBERTARIAN VIEWS ON MOST EVERYTHING ELSE.AMONG THE RANDOM XXX SCENES, CULLED FROM FILMS LIKE HER LAST FLING AND THE ULTIMATE PLEASURE, IS EVEN A BLACK-AND-WHITE 3-WAY LOOP FEATURING JOEY SILVERA AND LESLIE BOVEE. ONE LENGTHY ORGY SEQUENCE IS DEFECTIVE, BUT TOBALINA INCLUDES IT ANYWAY, HAVING THE NARRATOR APOLOGIZE A COUPLE OF TIMES FOR THE ""FLARE AND GLARE"", EVEN GIVING THE BLAME TO IRIS WHO SUPPOSEDLY WORKED AS CAMERA OPERATOR (WE SEE DUMB SHOTS OF HER STANDING BEHIND A HUGE (MITCHELL?) STATIONARY CAMERA WITH FERNANDO FORTES AS FOCUS PULLER), AND WHEN SHE IS ACTUALLY ON SCREEN VICTIMIZED BY SAID F&AMP;G, CAREFULLY EXPLAINING THAT TOBALINA ON CAMERA IS NOT TO FAULT BECAUSE HE HAD INHERITED THE FAULTY CAMERA SETTINGS FROM HER. HEY CT, WHY NOT SCOUR YOUR VAULTS AND REPLACE THE FAULTY FOOTAGE WITH SOMETHING ELSE BUDDY?WHICH OF COURSE RAISES THE QUESTION OF OUR DEAR VIDEO DISTRIBUTORS, IN THE LAST THROES OF REISSUING VINTAGE PORN ON DVD (LET'S IGNORE STREAMING FOR THE MOMENT) TO A GULLIBLE BUT RAPIDLY DWINDLING MODERN AUDIENCE (MYSELF ESPECIALLY INCLUDED, SINCE I AM A PRIME CUSTOMER).

579,"1960 WAS BUSY TIME FOR DIRECTOR AARNE TARKAS WHO COMPLETED NO LESS THAN FIVE FEATURE FILMS THAT YEAR. THE QUALITY VARIES; OUT OF THE FIVE MOVIES, OPETTAJATAR SEIKKAILEE IS VERY ENTERTAINING WHILE KANKKULAN KAIVOLLA IS JUST DAFT AND BORING. NINA JA ERIK, TARKAS' FIRST MOVIE OF THE YEAR, STRIVES TO BE A SERIOUS DRAMA ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE'S RESTLESSNESS, BUT HAS LOST SOME OF ITS EFFECT OVER THE YEARS.THE FIRST THING WE SEE IS A TRIAL WHERE TWO YOUNG MEN CALLED ERIK VAARA AND HEIKKI KORTE (MARTTI KATAJISTO AND VILLE-VEIKKO SALMINEN) ARE SENTENCED TO PRISON AND A YOUNG WOMAN NINA SWAHN (PIRKKO MANNOLA) TO PROBATION. NINA GOES ON TO HAVE A DISCUSSION WITH ERIK'S FATHER (TAUNO PALO), PROMPTING SEVERAL FLASHBACKS TO ILLUSTRATE HOW THINGS BECAME WHAT THEY ARE: NINA AND ERIK ARE ORIGINALLY FRUSTRATED WITH THEIR WEALTHY PARENTS WHEN MEETING EACH OTHER IN THE COUNTRYSIDE AND QUICKLY FALL IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER. HOWEVER, ERIK'S THINLY VEILED ANGER TOWARD HIS FATHER AND JEALOUSY TO NINA'S TOUGH EX-BOYFRIEND HEIKKI A.K.A. HESSU CAUSE THINGS TO DEVELOP INTO A DANGEROUS DIRECTION.THE ALWAYS LOVELY PIRKKO MANNOLA IS CLEARLY THE HIGHLIGHT OF THE MOVIE THAT OTHERWISE OFTEN SEEMS OVERLY SERIOUS AND POMPOUS; I JUST WISH HER CHARACTER HAD BEEN WRITTEN MORE DIVERSE THAN THE ALWAYS POSITIVE SIDEKICK FOR THE MEN THAT SHE IS NOW. THE LAUGHABLY OVERAGE MARTTI KATAJISTO (IN HIS THIRTIES!) IS ANYTHING BUT CONVINCING AS THE BROODING YOUNG MAN BARELY OUT OF HIS TEENS WHOSE MENACING FITS OF ANGER ARE SUPPOSED TO DRIVE THE PLOT FORWARD, BUT DO SO WAY TOO SLOWLY TO BE INTERESTING. THE YOUNG COUPLE'S ROMANTIC STROLLING ON A BEACH AND IN A FOREST CABIN COULD TECHNICALLY BE FITTING IN A MORE ATMOSPHERIC FILM, BUT HERE THEY FEEL PROLONGED AND EVEN DULL IN SPITE OF PIRKKO MANNOLA'S CHARISMA AND SKIMPY SWIMSUITS. TAUNO PALO ALSO COMES ACROSS AS RATHER STIFF AS ERIK'S FATHER. STILL, THE COOL VILLE-VEIKKO SALMINEN IS FUNNY AS THE CAR-STEALING BAD BOY HESSU, INTENTIONALLY OR NOT.FURTHERMORE, THE HEAVY-HANDED STYLE IS EMPHASIZED BY THE DRAMATIC AND FREQUENTLY SENTIMENTAL SCORE. EVEN THOUGH NINA JA ERIK IS NOT COMPLETELY HOPELESS, IT WOULD HAVE REALLY NEEDED A MORE RELAXED ATTITUDE TO THE SUBJECT MATTER TO WORK WELL AS A PORTRAYAL OF YOUNG PEOPLE'S EMOTIONAL TURMOIL – THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF THE STORY JUST DON'T FALL INTO PLACE HERE.

580,"THE FINNISH NISKAVUORI SERIES IS A FAMILY SAGA AT ITS BEST AND PORTRAYS SOME OF THE BEST ACTOR AND ACTRESS PERFORMANCES, BUT YOU COULD EXPECT AS MUCH WITH ONE THE BEST FINNISH DIRECTORS, EDWIN LAINE. IT'S A SHAME THAT MOVIES LIKE THESE DO NOT GET WORLD-WIDE DISTRIBUTION, BECAUSE THEY DESERVE IT, BUT THE LANGUAGE BARRIER IS ONE VERY BIG OBSTACLE. THE POWERFUL STORYTELLING OF THE NISKAVUORI SERIES WAS CREATED BY HELLA WUOLIJOKI WHO PORTRAYED THE TIMES, CUSTOMS AND PEOPLE THE WAY THEY WERE.THE NISKAVUORI FAMILY ALWAYS HAD STRONG WOMEN AND WEAK MEN, WHETHER THEY WERE BORN INTO THE FAMILY OR MARRIED TO IT. THE WOMEN WERE PATIENT, WISE AND RAN THE BUSINESS AFFAIRS BEING DEFINITELY THE CORNER STONE OF THE FAMILY, WHILE MEN HAD AFFAIRS, DRANK OR OTHERWISE DIDN'T PROVE TO HAVE THE SPINE TO KEEP THE FAMILY TOGETHER.AARNE WAS ONE SUCH MALE CHARACTER. INSTEAD OF WANTING TO CONTINUE THE TRADITION OF RUNNING THE FAMILY FARM, HE HAD AN AFFAIR WITH A TEACHER, LEFT HIS WIFE AND MOVED TO HE CITY WITH THE TEACHER. ANYTHING LIKE THAT WAS A SCANDAL IN THOSE DAYS. LATER, OF COURSE, HE RETURNED BACK TO THE FARM, WHICH AGAIN WAS A MANIFESTATION OF THE STRONG ATTACHMENT TO LAND AND TRADITION THAT FINNISH PEOPLE SHARE.EDWIN LAINE ALSO DIRECTED A REMAKE OF THE MOVIE, I THINK IT WAS IN THE 80'S, WHICH WAS JUST AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL.

589,"YEARS 1939-45 WERE DARK YEARS IN ALL OF EUROPE, INCLUDING FINLAND WHICH SUFFERED FROM TWO DEVASTATING WARS WITH THE SOVIET UNION DURING THOSE YEARS. THE POLITICAL SITUATION ALSO AFFECTED THE CINEMA OF FINLAND MORE OR LESS DIRECTLY; OF THE MOVIES PRODUCED IN THOSE YEARS, MANY WERE LIGHTWEIGHT COMEDIES AIMED TO CHEER PEOPLE UP WHILE AVOIDING SENSITIVE POLITICAL SUBJECTS. ONE SUCH ROM-COM IS JORMA NORTIMO'S PERHEEN MUSTA LAMMAS FROM EARLY 1941, THE INTERIM PEACE ERA.A MAN IN WOMEN'S CLOTHES HAS BEEN A STAPLE OF THE COMEDY GENRE FOR WHO KNOWS HOW LONG, BUT THE JOKE WORKS THE OTHER WAY ROUND TOO. PERHEEN MUSTA LAMMAS IS THE STORY OF AN ORPHANED OFFICE WORKER NAMED RAILI WIRMA (SIRKKA SIPILÄ) WHO MOVES INTO HER OWN APARTMENT FROM THE CUSTODY OF HER THREE OPPRESSIVE AUNTS. SOON SHE FINDS HERSELF DEEP IN DEBT AND BREAKS UP WITH HER BOYFRIEND TOPI (DIRECTOR NORTIMO), BUT GETS AN IDEA WHEN SHE ACCIDENTALLY GETS A JOB AS AN ERRAND BOY WHILE BEING DRESSED AS A GUY FOR LAUGHS. IN ORDER TO MAKE MONEY FOR HER CREDITORS, SHE TRIES TO MAINTAIN SEVERAL FALSE IDENTITIES IN DIFFERENT JOBS – EASIER SAID THAN DONE.THE HUMOUR IS NOT HIGHLY IMAGINATIVE, BUT THERE ARE MANY AMUSING DETAILS IN THE MOVIE ANYWAY. SIPILÄ LOOKS FUNNY AS A BOY AND PRETTY AS A GIRL AND CERTAIN SUPPORTING CHARACTERS ARE FUN TOO, FOR EXAMPLE SIIRI ANGERKOSKI AS RAILI'S UNCLE'S WIFE SALLI (A FORMER OPERA DIVA) AND THE TRIO OF RAILI'S CONSERVATIVE AUNTS (ELSA TURAKAINEN, VERNA PIPONIUS AND HENNY VALJUS) WHO COMPLETE EACH OTHER'S SENTENCES LIKE HUEY, DEWEY AND LOUIE IN CLASSIC DONALD DUCK COMICS. SOME CINEMATIC TECHNIQUES ARE MORE INTERESTING THAN IN MANY AVERAGE OLD FINN-FILMS: THE SURREAL DREAM SEQUENCE AND THE CLOTHES-CHANGING SCENE IN A MOVING ELEVATOR LOOK COOL, AS DOES THE SEMI-LONG TAKE INTRODUCING THE BEAUTY PARLOUR WHERE RAILI FINDS A JOB UNDER A FALSE NAME. SOME MOMENTS ARE ALSO A BIT MORE RISQUÉ THAN EXPECTED FROM A MOVIE OF THE ERA.NEVERTHELESS, I DON'T THINK THE ROMANTIC PLOT LINES WORK AS WELL AS THE IDENTITY-RELATED ONES. RAILI HAS THREE MEN TRYING TO WOO HER, BUT THE FINAL RELATIONSHIP FEELS LIKE AN OBLIGATORY HAPPY ENDING INSTEAD OF A NATURAL PART OF THE STORY. EVEN SO, RAILI HERSELF IS AN INTERESTING CHARACTER THANKS TO HER OPENNESS TO SHADY METHODS LIKE STEALING AND DECEIVING IN ORDER TO REACH HER GOALS. STILL, SHE TOO HAS TO TASTE HER OWN MEDICINE WHEN AN ARTIST NAMED RAUTIA (JOEL RINNE) BLACKMAILS HER INTO BECOMING A NUDE MODEL FOR HIM. THIS PLOT DETAIL IN PARTICULAR IS ACTUALLY SURPRISINGLY DARK CONSIDERING THE ROM-COM PREMISE, BUT IN THE END EVERYTHING IS RESOLVED WITH NO HARD FEELINGS, OF COURSE. I DOUBT A SIMILAR JOKE COULD BE DONE IN A MODERN COMEDY WITHOUT ACCUSATIONS OF SEXISM – ATTITUDES DO CHANGE OVER TIME.IN ANY CASE, AS A WHOLE I THOUGHT THE MOVIE IS SOMEWHAT WATCHABLE AND ENTERTAINING LITTLE COMEDY. IT IS NOT JORMA NORTIMO'S BEST FILM AND I THINK FUNNIER MOVIES HAVE BEEN MADE IN FINLAND AND ELSEWHERE, BUT IF NOTHING ELSE IS ON, PERHEEN MUSTA LAMMAS MAKES AN ALRIGHT PASTIME FOR 90 MINUTES.",COMEDY

762,"BOTH FILMPORTAL AND WIKIPEDIA GIVE THE DATE OF THE OPENING AS APRIL 7, 1945. THIS MAKES NOLTENIUS BROTHERS QUITE SPECIAL - AS THE LAST OF THE TWELVE GERMAN FILMS WHICH RECEIVED ITS PREMIERE BETWEEN JANUARY 1 AND THE CAPITULATION OF GERMANY ON MAY 7, 1945. TO BE PRECISE, ANOTHER FILM - VIA MALA - RECEIVED IT'S FIRST PUBLIC SHOWING ON THE SAME DAY (IN THE SMALL TOWN OF MAYRHOFEN, WHERE THE FILMING TOOK PLACE, BUT NO LONGER MADE IT TO THE CINEMAS UNTIL 1948). SO, EXACTLY ONE MONTH BEFORE DAY ZERO, THERE WAS A GOOD DAY FOR GERMAN CINEMA.THE NOLTENIUS BROTHERS IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU WOULD IMAGINE IT TO BE: VERY SERIOUS, SOMBRE, DIGNIFIED; A STORY ABOUT HONOR AND DUTY AND RESPONSIBILITY. EVERYTHING IS PLAYED OUT INDOORS (AS IT WAS, BY THE LATE 1944, RATHER DIFFICULT TO FILM ANYTHING OUTDOORS AND STILL TRY TO HIDE THE FACT THERE'S A WAR ON), IN AN OLD PATRICIAN HOUSEHOLD, WHICH SERVES AS A REMINDER OF AN ERA THAT WOULD BE GONE FOREVER ANY MOMENT. IT'S A ""MODERN"" FILM (MEANING THE ACTION SUPPOSEDLY TAKES PLACE IN THE PRESENT), BUT THE WHOLE STORY-LINE WOULD HAVE WORKED BETTER, HAD THE SETTING BEEN CHANGED TO SAY, LATE 1800S - WE GET A BUNCH OF VERY DIGNIFIED GENTLEMEN OF THE TOWN COUNCIL HAVING VERY DIGNIFIED MEETINGS; AT HOME THERE IS A RATHER BORING MOUSEY LITTLE HAUSFRAU, SUPPOSEDLY TORN BY SOME INNER EMOTIONS WHEN MEETING AGAIN 'THE OTHER BROTHER' WHOM SHE DID NOT MARRY SOME TWENTY YEARS AGO. WHAT MAKES IT INTERESTING, IS, OF COURSE, THE FACT THAT WE ARE SEEING 1945 - BUT A WARPED, FUN-HOUSE MIRROR VERSION OF THAT YEAR, WHERE THERE IS NO WAR, PEOPLE ARE DANCING AND LINGERING IN DEEP THOUGHTS AT THE GRAND PIANOS, AS IF IN A FROZEN DREAM. THE ATMOSPHERE IS SIMILAR TO OPFERGANG (1944), IN ITSELF A MUCH MORE INTERESTING FILM (AND IN COLOR).THIS POOR FILM ONLY MANAGED TO STAY IN CINEMAS (THOSE, THAT WERE STILL STANDING) FOR A WEEK OR SO, AS THE BATTLE FOR BERLIN WITH IT'S BRUTAL DOOR-TO-DOOR COMBAT BEGAN THE VERY NEXT WEEK.

1615,"HMS HOOD, A BRITISH BATTLESHIP, WAS THE PRIDE OF THE NAVY. IT HAD BEEN LAUNCHED IN 1918 AND HAD SEEN NO COMBAT BUT HAD SAILED AROUND TO BRITISH COLONIES SHOWING THE FLAG FOR TWENTY YEARS, A PUBLIC ICON. SHE WAS OLD BUT POWERFUL AND EFFICIENT AND CARRIED A SYMBOLIC CHARGE. THE HOOD'S CHIEF WEAKNESS WAS HER DECK ARMOR. THERE WAS PLENTY OF STEEL AROUND HER HULL, USEFUL IN CONTAINING DAMAGE FROM TORPEDOES OR FLAT FIRE. BUT OVER THE YEARS NAVAL WEAPONRY HAD EVOLVED.UNLIKE THE PIRATE SHIPS OF THE MOVIES, SHIPS NO LONGER HAD TO BE CLOSE TO EACH OTHER TO DO DAMAGE. SHELLS COULD BE FIRED FROM MILES AWAY. THIS TOOK THE SHELLS INTO A HIGH TRAJECTORY SO WHEN THEY REACHED THE TARGET THEY WERE COMING DOWN AT AN EXTREME ANGLE. THIS WAS CALLED ""PLUNGING FIRE"" AND MADE THE DECKS VULNERABLE. REALIZING THIS, THE BRITISH HALTED THE HOOD'S CONSTRUCTION MIDWAY AND ARMORED THE FORWARD PART OF HER DECK. THE ARMOR WASN'T EXTENDED AFT FOR FEAR OF CUTTING DOWN THE SHIP'S SPEED WITH THE EXTRA WEIGHT.THE GERMAN BATTLESHIP, KMS BISMARK, WAS NEWER, LAUNCHED IN 1939, AND WAS THE MOST POWERFUL WARSHIP AFLOAT AT THE TIME, ALONG WITH HER SISTER SHIP, TIRPITZ. BUT THE BISMARK WAS MORE THAN JUST AN INSTRUMENT OF WAR. IT WAS BEAUTIFUL IN ITS LINES AND OVERALL DESIGN. BISMARK LOOKED AS IF SHE HAD BEEN BUILT BY AN ARCHITECT WHO HAPPENED ALSO TO BE AN ENGINEER. SHE CARRIED EIGHT 15-INCH GUNS THAT FIRED A SHELL WEIGHING NEARLY HALF A TON AT ALMOST TWICE THE SPEED OF SOUND. SHE ALSO HAD SUPERIOR OPTICAL INSTRUMENTS AND FIRE CONTROL.BISMARK SLIPPED OUT OF PORT AND INTO THE NORTH ATLANTIC, A MAJOR THREAT TO THE CONVOYS FROM NORTH AMERICA THAT WERE QUITE LITERALLY BRITAIN'S LIFELINE. BISMARK AND THE HEAVY CRUISER, PRINCE EUGEN, WERE SPOTTED AND PURSUED BY HOOD AND THE NEW, UNTRIED BATTLESHIP, PRINCE OF WALES. HOOD'S CAPTAIN HOLLAND KNEW ABOUT THE PROBLEM WITH HIS WEAK DECK ARMOR AND, FINALLY CATCHING UP TO THE ENEMY, PROCEEDED AT FLANK SPEED TO CLOSE THE RANGE AND AVOID PLUNGING FIRE.BUT NOW THE PROBLEM WAS THAT SINCE HOOD AND PRINCE OF WALES WERE HEADING DIRECTLY FOR THE TARGET, ONLY THEIR FORWARD GUNS COULD BE USED, WHILE BISMARK WAS ABLE TO FIRE BROADSIDES WITH ALL OF HER GUNS. THIS AND OTHER DETAILS WERE OMITTED FROM THE POPULAR BRITISH FEATURE FILM, ""SINK THE BISMARK."" HOLLAND HAD ALMOST REACHED THE POINT AT WHICH HE WAS SAFE ENOUGH FROM PLUNGING FIRE TO TURN BROADSIDE AND ENGAGE ALL OF HIS GUNS, BUT HE BEGAN THE TURN A FEW SECONDS TOO LATE.THE BISMARK FIRED A SALVO THAT HAD TO TRAVEL ABOUT TEN MILES AND DID SO IN ONLY THIRTY SECONDS. ONE OF THE SHELLS APPARENTLY STRUCK THE UNDERARMORED REAR DECK COVERING THE MAGAZINES. THE HOOD BLEW UP WITH A TREMENDOUS EXPLOSION, BEGAN TO SINK IMMEDIATELY, AND TOOK ALMOST ALL HER CREW WITH HER. THERE WERE THREE SURVIVORS, ONLY ONE NOW LEFT ALIVE, TED BRIGGS.IT'S AN EPIC STORY, FILLED WITH TRAGEDY AND EVENTUAL TRIUMPH.

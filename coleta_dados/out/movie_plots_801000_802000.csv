The llama is the most useful of their work animals. The most conspicuous aspect of the native dress is their derby hats, the origins which are unknown.

FitzPatrick,"Dedicated as a park in 1919, Zion National Park, located in Utah, is considered one of the most spectacular naturally formed canyons and one of the most precious scenic possessions of the United States government. The colorful and stratified cliff walls of the canyon were once under the sea, and geologic upheaval and other natural forces created what is present today. One of the most renowned natural sites in the park is the seven hundred foot long Arch of Zion. To provide human access to the park, man made structures are just as spectacular in their engineering accomplishments. These include the Mount Carmel Highway and Tunnel, and Zion Lodge, where young female college students of Mormon faith welcome guests to the park. Contrasting with the huge canyon walls are some of the small alpine plants indigenous to the area, such as the Zion lily.",English,United States,N/A,6.2,110,tt1623343,N/A

There's little science and lots of fireworks, however not even the fireworks are that spectacular. Apparently they have interviewed some paleontologists but just kept the most exaggerated, flashy assertions.The other two parts of each episode are the CGI and the mechanic reconstructions. The CGI is poor for the year, very poor indeed. Movements are quite jerky many times, and they reuse the same scenes over and over again. The mechanic reconstruction of each episode is, according to the narrator, the very first time something like it has been done, and after three times of listening to that, you simply stop believing anything else they say.The narration also sells them as if they're the most spectacular thing ever done related to fossils, and it seems the paleontologists who were lucky to work in them had a great time, but they didn't impress me because of the selling point.Seen as a whole, the thing looks more like a commercial than a documentary. And I'm not buying it. A documentary should lay the facts, and the viewer could reach one or another conclusion, but this thing just tries to convince you that everything is the most extreme thing ever, and it doesn't hold up to expectations.In short: not awful, but not worth it either.

Niña de mi corazón,2010,N/A,60 min,Drama,N/A,Abel Santa Cruz,"Maribel Guardia, Arturo Peniche, Erick Elias","I love this show and I don't normally watch telenovelas. Paulina Goto is smoking hot and so is Jade Fraser. The show is funny, interesting, and always keeps me wanting more. The music is also great. Paulina Goto does her own singing and the songs featured on the show and her voice are beautiful. A few criticisms include the cheap tattoo work on the bad guy, the crap religious theme, a few unresolved issues from certain story lines (like her brother stealing money from a family friend), and too much of the bad guys getting their way and not enough retaliation from the good guys. The evil girl in the show wins too much and doesn't get knocked down or smacked around when she should, same goes for her mother. Even the moms on the show are hot older women. Another criticism is the lack of chemistry between Paulina Goto and the guys she makes out with. Although she was 17 or 18 years old at the time of the filming, she knew she would be making out with guys in their mid 20's to early 30's. If she didn't want to kiss older guys she shouldn't have take the job. Overall, it was still a show that I really loved and I miss. I wish there were several more episodes of this telenovela that were made. Hopefully it's out on Blu-Ray or DVD soon.",Spanish,Mexico,1 win & 2 nominations,5.6,39,tt1624313,N/A

Of all the valiant and talented warriors in this elite army, Badrinath (Allu Arjun) is one who is groomed by Bheeshma Narayan and wishes to make Badri his successor. Once, a group of terrorists attacked Amarnath Temple and killed some devotees, Badri fought and killed those criminals, saving both the temple and the devotees. Meanwhile Alakananda (Tamanna), who is a staunch agnostic due to certain circumstances, along with her family is visiting Badrinath Temple, to which Badri is appointed as the protector. Her grandfather explains to Badri that she is in danger as Sarkar (Kelly Dorjee), a dreaded don, is trying to force her marriage with his son. On the request of her grandfather, Badri helps Alaknanda to gradually believe in God's existence. Eventually Alakananda falls deeply in love with Badri, unbeknownst to him, and is not willing to lose him at any cost. Sarkar and his men follow Alaknanda to Badrinath, and try to kidnap her. Although Badri manages to save her, he is heavily injured and goes under medication. Meanwhile Bheeshma Narayan is shocked upon seeing Alakananda's affectionate behaviour towards Badri when he lay injured. As it is a strict rule that only an unmarried man must be the next guru who would lead the elite warriors, Bheeshma Narayan becomes highly suspicious that Badri is in love with Alakananda, which is not the real situation. Badri promises Alakananda that he would bring her back to Badrinath Temple for success in her love, unaware that he is the object of her love in the first place. As per the promise, Badri goes to Bellary to free Alakananda from the clutches of Sarkar, who is planning to fix the marriage, and escort Alaknanda back to the holy shrine. He fights with all the goons and escorts her to Badrinath. Sarkar vows revenge on Badri as Sarkar's son is severely hurt in the process by Badri. Subsequently Sarkar leads his goons to Badrinath and destroys Bheeshma Narayan's ashram. Feeling that Badri is the real traitor and loves Alakananda, Bheeshma Narayan orders Badri to vacate Badrinath Temple. Meanwhile Alakananda is being taken away by Sarkar's men, and Alakananda proposes to Badri to which he rejects as he has dedicated his life to his guru. After seeing Alakananda's pure love for Badri, Bheeshma Narayan is moved and orders Badri to bring her back and marry her. Following his guru's orders, Badri saves Alakananda and finally marries her. In the end, Bheeshma Narayan asks them to hand over one of their children so that he can make him his successor to which they agree happily.",Telugu,India,2 wins,4.5,"2,580",tt1625856,N/A

Emir is a Bosnian émigré, removed during the war and now struggling to rediscover his homeland. He has returned to assist an American director in the making of a film about Visoko's pyramids. Everyone in the town is asked to participate, including Avdija, a tourist agent with the Pyramid Foundation, Semir Osmanagi_, the quixotic founder of the Valley of the Pyramids, and Zombi, who oversees the digging of the labyrinthine tunnels found beneath the hills. Emir and his director are accused by the press of being like ""Borat in Bosnia,"" seeking to mock the town's believers. Emir's outlandish behavior grows more excessive and confused, culminating in a grandiose shoot at the summit of the Moon Pyramid that descends into chaos. He is taken into the heart of the Pyramid of the Sun, where he is forced to confront his beliefs. Where does fact end and fiction begin? How do you make the film of a pyramid that can't be seen?

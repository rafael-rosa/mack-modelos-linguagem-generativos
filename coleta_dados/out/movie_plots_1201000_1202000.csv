Her family is part of a fundamentalist Catholic community. Maria lives her everyday life in the modern world, yet her heart belongs to Jesus. She wants to follow him, to become a saint and go to heaven - just like all those holy children she's always been told about. So Maria goes through 14 stations, just like Jesus did on his path to Golgatha, and reaches her goal in the end. Not even Christian, a boy she meets at school, can stop her, even if in another world, they might have become friends, or even more. Left behind is a broken family that finds comfort in faith, and the question if all these events were really so inevitable. STATIONS OF THE CROSS is an indictment and, at the same time, the legend of a saint. It's a story of religion, devotion and radical faith, and the film itself comes along just as radical as the subject matter, telling the story in only 14 fixed-angle long shots, allowing the viewer to contemplate the interactions on screen in an entirely different way than in a traditional film.","German, French, Latin","Germany, France",9 wins & 8 nominations,7.4,"4,663",tt3465916,68

Filmmaking in Iran is subject to tight government controls and strict censorship codes ranging from banning any criticism of the regime to highly restrictive codes on representation of women and their interactions with men. The imposed codes have undermined the creativity of the filmmakers and their ability to tackle pressing social issues. ""A Cinema of Discontent"" explores the censorship codes through analyzing dozens of clips from mainstream and art-house films. It features insightful interviews with 12 Iranian filmmakers, including the internationally-acclaimed directors Jafar Panahi, Bahman Ghobadi, and the Oscar-winning Asghar Farhadi (A Separation) The Film also documents the brave efforts of the filmmakers whose defiance and subversion of the codes have been be punished by being banned from working, imprisonment, and forced exile.",Persian,"United States, Iran",N/A,6.1,23,tt3467794,N/A

And while they are very different in tone, a slight connection can be made.This is actually a fairly amusing little tale. Although nothing like this has happened to me (I never worked a desk job), the appeal of getting revenge on those who wrong you is certainly appealing.

Lustful Housewives,2012,N/A,99 min,"Adult, Drama, Romance",Kendo,N/A,"Rebecca More, Megan Coxxx, Angell Summers","Most of Kendo's output for the French label Dorcel is mindless junk, for which Mr. K boasts in nearly Trumpian fashion about his artistic brilliance (not) in the accompanying ""Making Of"" filler short subjects. This early entry in the series bowled me over, loaded with eroticism missing from his gonzo crap and also catching me by surprise, having previously sat through dozens of his worst.One key factor is the retention of direct-sound English dialog from the mainly British cast, an element both Kendo and producer Marc Dorsel jettisoned for future offerings in favor of 100% reliance on narration. The improvised patter is not scintillating, but permits characterizations to be built instead of the generic sex workers humping for the camera that Kendo usually ends up with.Rebecca More is most impressive as the head MILF, a housewife introed doing housework, but soon invited by hubby Pascal White to a threesome where she's blindfolded. It's pure fetish action, Kendo's undeniable forte, but a harbinger of quality to come in each of six concise vignettes.I especially liked the red, black and white color scheme Kendo adheres to, as well as having his male cast members in fancy dress (or in the case of Demetri XXX, a quality suit). Kendo is all about style and at least this time out he delivers quality.More also gets a lesbian scene with Brit Porn superstar Megan Coxxx, while Amica Bentley comes in second in terms of screen time and performance acumen, getting to indulge in infidelity due to her hubby (Kai Taylor) losing at chess. Kendo pretentiously expounds on the game of chess's relevance to recurring thematics in his movies, but he utterly bungles the actual chess match he stages, which I thought was over half-way through. He once made a poker-themed porn feature, and likewise blew that one too.","French, English",France,N/A,4.5,11,tt3468006,N/A

Heavy Metal: The Evolution of the Naval Warship,2009,N/A,90 min,"Documentary, History, War",N/A,N/A,N/A,"This two-hour series covers the evolution of the design and armament of ocean-going warships. From wooden hulls and sails to nuclear powered floating naval bases, Heavy Metal has it all. The first hour of the series tells the story of wind-driven vessels, from the Viking longship to the effective end of the sail era, in 1860. The Vikings used a larger version of their longship for trade. It evolved into the medieval cog, a merchant vessel, which, led to the development of the carrack. This ship, with the advent of gunpowder, evolved into the galleon. The most famous example this new style was Drake's Golden Hinde, and having a fleet of these much nimbler ships enabled the English to defeat the awkward Spanish Armada, in 1588. The galleon quickly evolved into the tougher, faster Dutch East Indiaman trading ship, which provided the basic design of warships from the mid-1600s to 1860. Nelson's Victory and the other great ships of the Napoleonic era were really just larger, somewhat more refined versions of the Dutch East Indiaman. The second hour of Heavy Metal covers the steam age from 1860 with the launching of the Warrior to about 2010. It is the story of the evolution and extinction of the battleship, which is a specific type of vessel, designed to fight other battleships in large, decisive fleet actions. The advent of the submarine and the aircraft carrier made the battleship obsolete.",English,United States,N/A,6.6,14,tt4269678,N/A

His captors, who dub themselves The Gang of Barbarians, operate under the assumption that his Jewish heritage means he is worth a lot of money. Taking the audience through the harrowing experience of the Halimi family and sharing a searing insight into Ilan's vicious ordeal, the story tracks the massive but futile investigation doomed by near-misses and tragedy that triggered a national outcry. For 24 days the police, insistent upon handling the case as a normal for-ransom kidnapping, failed to recognize the anti-Semitic overtones of the abduction.

Iubire elenã,2012,N/A,100 min,"Drama, Romance",Geo Saizescu,Kostas Asimakopoulos,"Maia Morgenstern, Mircea Rusu, Georgiana Saizescu","Fans of Romanian cinema and viewers who follow the movies coming from Romania have two good reasons to want to see ""Iubire elena"" (""Greek Love"") made in 2012. This was the latest film by Geo Saizescu (1932-2013), a film director known in Romania for a more than half a century activity that includes successful comedies that were quite popular with the local audiences, also because they were among the few such films in made in the comical genre during the communist era. The second reason is the presence in the lead role of Maia Morgenstern, one of the best theater and film actresses in Romania today, known also (but less than she deserves) internationally. Unfortunately, the film is disappointing in all respects.""Iubire elena"" is the screen adaptation of a theater play whose story unfolds in two parallel planes. A well-situated woman from southern Greece invites an art critic from Athens to offer him for sale a painting of a 19th-century woman painter with a tumultuous destiny who had destroyed most of her works. Two soap operas interleave on screen, one of which tells the life of the painter, the other is about the hesitating relationship that blossoms between the man and woman, both at the age of maturity. None of the stories is interesting, and the characters do not have enough consistency to win at any moment the audience's sympathy. It could be a film about art, it could be a feminist film, it could be a movie about love. None of these threads is followed. The two parallel stories meet only in a single moment that seems almost a parody. It is also the only comical moment in this film made by a director specialized in comedies, but unfortunately it's involuntary humor.Nothing works cinematically. The story takes place in Greece and Italy, but the film is spoken most of the time in Romanian. Contemporary sequences resemble filmed theater, the historical ones look like a biographical documentary with actors, none of them are of good quality. Outdoor filming resembles clips of tourist advertising. The interior of the main heroine house resembles a small palace, but it does not fit to the economic status of a tourist guide who has alone raised a child that she claims being. Surprisingly, even continuity errors occur. Although the film is full of dialogues and off-screen comments, we learn close to nothing about the heroes excepting the woman interpreted by Maia Morgenstern. Her character is better served by the script and by acting, although the style of interpretation belongs to theater rather than cinema. Seeing Maia is always a delight, but even she cannot save this movie.Geo Saizescu belonged to the group of Romanian film directors who made good or at least reasonable films under the difficult conditions of communist-era ideological control, but who after 1989 failed to create the films that their viewers were expecting.""Iubire elena"" is a disappointing final piece in a complicated career.",Romanian,Romania,N/A,6.0,27,tt4272512,N/A

The Founder,2016,PG-13,115 min,"Biography, Drama",John Lee Hancock,Robert Siegel,"Michael Keaton, Nick Offerman, John Carroll Lynch","1954. Having worked as a salesman most of his adult life, Ray Kroc has been a hustler in most senses of the word. That hustling has made him the target of derision among certain circles for peddling what have ended up being more novelty or faddish than useful products, but it has also placed more than a comfortable roof in Arlington Heights, Illinois over his and his wife Ethel's heads. Ethel, however, wishes that he placed as much effort into being at home with her as he does in selling; his current job of peddling five-spindle milkshake makers for Prince Castle which has him constantly on the road going from one drive-in restaurant to another. It is because of the beefs he has with the whole drive-in experience (bad food, bad service) in constantly eating at such establishments while on the road that he becomes enthralled with the concept of McDonald's Restaurant in San Bernardino, California, owned and operated by brothers Richard McDonald and Maurice McDonald - Dick and Mac. Unlike most of Ray's customers who will only require one five-spindle milkshake maker at any given time, the McDonald brothers end up purchasing eight machines for their single restaurant. Primarily on Dick's initiative, the brothers have redesigned the whole concept of the drive-in restaurant to focus on quality food through a smaller menu of only the most popular items (hamburgers, fries, sodas), consistency in product so that customers know what to expect from time to time, change in the target market from lounging teenagers to families, and perhaps most importantly speed in having any order ready within seconds, many of these goals achievable through assembly line styled production. They had tried franchising previously, but failed in that they lost control over many of those aspects which made their San Bernardino restaurant successful. Despite believing Ray a bit off kilter (in other words, crazy), the McDonald brothers somewhat hesitantly enter into a contract with him to be their head of franchising. Ray's experience in the job is not without its problems, especially as his franchisees seem to be making more money than he is, he who is only breaking even. He is not averse to advancing ideas provided to him to get ahead - original ideas which are not his forte - he seeing the brothers as his biggest problem in they thinking small. These differences lead to a standoff between Ray and the brothers, the former who has a different goal for ""his"" business in profit and stoking his own ego seemingly his main priorities.","English, Yiddish",United States,1 win & 5 nominations total,7.2,"197,975",tt4276820,66

His goal: convince Moscow to allow him back in to Siberia, so he can complete his record-setting 20-year, 36,000-mile walk around the world. In 1998, with only $300 to his name, Bushby set out on a challenge to complete the longest continuous walk in human history. Planning to return to his home in Britain on foot, he left the southern tip of South America and walked up through Central America, North America and into Russia, successfully completing the first documented on-foot crossing of the Bering Strait from Alaska to Russia. After trekking nearly 2,000 miles into the grueling Siberian tundra, the Russian government placed a five-year visa ban on Bushby, halting the expedition to which he has already dedicated a third of his life. Now, this modern-day adventurer is walking from Los Angeles to the Russian Embassy in Washington, D.C. with his visa application in hand, in hopes of overturning the ban and continuing what he started sixteen years ago. The trek take will Bushby through the Western deserts, over the Rockies, across the Great Plains, over the Appalachians and onwards to the U.S. Capital.

Horatio,2019,N/A,86 min,Drama,Mathias Mangin,Mathias Mangin,"Maria Luísa Mendonça, Eucir de Souza, Marcelo Drummond","""Horatio"" tells the story of a dysfunctional family, in which social norms no longer exist, and where relationships are submitted to each one's impulses. The head of the family is Horatio, a smuggler on the run from the law, hiding in a surreal, baroque apartment with his daughter, Petula, and Milton, his favorite thug. While he keeps his daughter locked up in her bedroom, Horácio flirts with his goon, for whom he has had repressed feelings for years. However, Milton's love for a mysterious woman, and Petula's attempts to free herself with the help of a former lover, clash with Horacio's tyrannical whims. Both satirical and fantastical, the movie builds a tale of underworld crime in which issues such as harassment, chauvinism and greed reach a boiling point, progressively making it impossible for the characters to coexist.

Eva surprises her estranged husband with an ultimatum - she wants his help with a new fertility treatment so she can have another child, or else she will publicly name Joan in their divorce proceedings. McNaughton is unmoving, refusing to administer experimental drugs. McNaughton informs Joan of Eva's plan, forcing Joan to admit to Jim that she once had an affair with McNaughton. More pressing problems arise when Joan discovers that Maggie (and other young girls) are being sexually abused at Tarramar Girls Home. Desperate to get the girls to safety, Joan makes an unsavoury deal with Matron - only by reopening Stanton House will Maggie and the other pregnant girls have somewhere safe to go. As Matron convinces Norman to release the girls, Joan must persuade the retiring (and recalcitrant) Chairman of the Hospital Board to give Stanton House his blessing. At his retirement party, Joan puts on a charm offensive that succeeds - Stanton House will reopen. Meanwhile, in defending Martha against a racist slight, Bowditch gallantly pushes the inebriated Chairman into the pool, convincing Martha to propose to him in the process. When Joan and Matron turn up to collect the girls from Tarramar, Norman has hidden Maggie. With Cynthia's help they find her, and not before time - as in desperation, Maggie has swallowed bleach and is convulsing on the dormitory floor.

With the federal government's new guidelines of no more than fourteen units of alcohol a week as being low risk for both men and women, he goes on a quest to find out what effect consuming alcohol truly does have on humans. He himself gets measured to see if his alcohol consumption in a typical week in his life is within that guideline, and what effect the drinking over his lifetime has had thus far on the health of his liver, the organ most negatively affected by alcohol. He goes to a local pub to conduct an experiment on the short term effect of alcohol on the mind, such as on cognitive ability. Without the subjects touching a drop of alcohol, he then tries to answer the question of why certain people get drunk faster than others. Beyond the calories contained in alcohol, he then looks at if alcohol has an affect on potential weight gain by making people eat more. Unscientifically, he delves into the science of how lining one's stomach with food helps absorb alcohol more readily. He next looks into the common notion that moderate amounts of red wine consumption is heart healthy, as seen by what is known as the French paradox, the French who have an uncommonly low rate of heart disease despite a diet high in saturated fat. He goes to a sleep clinic to see if the myth that alcohol helps one sleep is true. Heading to a brewery, he tests various hangover remedies on brewery staff who've had a ""piss-up"". Associated, he sees if one type of alcoholic beverage is more apt to produce hangovers than another. Finally, he speaks to Prof. Dame Sally Davies, the country's Chief Medical Health Officer, about the evidence that led to the implementation of the most recent guidelines.",English,United Kingdom,N/A,6.4,593,tt5817374,N/A

John Murphy, then an elite adviser, analyst, and operative for the Army, CIA, and South Vietnamese intelligence services, reveals the gray areas of critical on-the-ground intelligence work, where trust is hard-won and easily lost. His challenges included: working with the local population to gather information, evaluating material and unreliable agents, dealing with the equally unreliable South Vietnamese Army, administering the controversial Phoenix Program, and confronting the 'body count' expectations of the Johnson administration's military bureaucracy. John's role was equal parts analyst, operative, and diplomat; it was confusion and misinformation from the ground level up. Using never-before-seen archival footage, documents, graphics, and photos, John analyzes why bad intelligence goes up the chain of command to become war policy - a concern as relevant today as it ever was.",English,United States,N/A,7.0,90,tt5817976,N/A

Little Sparta,2016,N/A,72 min,"Documentary, History, War",Mansoor Al Dhaheri,"Mansoor Al Dhaheri, Savas Alatis, Harecharan Sukumar",N/A,"""Little Sparta"" is a new long documentary that derives its name from a statement made by one of the high ranking generals of the international coalition who referred to the UAE as Little Sparta to symbolize the UAE's armed forces in this (country with tiny area) as an active and impressive force in the military operations in the war against Daesh (ISIL). Sparta was a prominent city-state in ancient Greece, known for its fighting prowess, became the dominant military power despite the limited number of its army who faced the Persians who had ambition of expanding into Europe, and defeated them in a way that revealed their valor, courage and exceptional training. Based on this, the Emirati writer and director Mansour Al Yabhooni Al Dhaheri projects his vision through profound historical reading of the region, documenting its history with highly professional technique, using the state-of-the-art and modern cinematic production tools. Not to mention the documentary script as if you're browsing through an interesting book. The book which consists of 9 chapters includes an introduction and title for each chapter and a conclusion including the objective and mission of this document. ""Little Sparta"" is a documentary epic film which is based on the idea that countries are not measured by their size or area, but rather by the strength of their peoples and their deep conviction that by persistence and diligence nations are built. To explain this idea, the film documents numerous facts that manifest itself in a highly professionally and clearly written script that starts with the story of the creation of the universe, and man's struggle for survival in a harsh environment where man was forced to invent tools to protect himself. And here lies the sin! The film's 9 chapters moves through from one historical era to another through pictures and documents that represent the eternal conflict between the forces of good and evil. It starts with the story of Sparta and the victory of its small regiment over the Persian Empire thanks to their training and determination, and moves into the emergence of Islam and its inspiration of hundreds of thousands of people and its spread in the region and its surroundings. It is known that the forces of evil has been ambushing their neighbors and taking advantage to assault them in order to move back to the era of the Kingdom of Ormus. Once again these forces of evil are seeking to control their neighbors through playing on the contradictions and disputes of the empires of that era, but a new victory for the forces of good over evil thanks to the vigilance and coalition of the Arab neighboring countries who overcame that aggression. Moving again to our contemporary age with a brief snapshot of the UAE history and its development, the film highlights with sight and sound one of the most important factors of prosperity in the country as a result of the harmony and peaceful coexistence among members of the society, as well as the tolerance whose foundations were laid down by its rulers the sheikhs and its citizens and residents who are provided with decent livelihoods. This scene was preceded by reference to the emergence of the radical and extremist groups in the world and the region who falsely claim to represent Islam. In the light of these two contradictory scenes, the film explains why the nickname ""Little Sparta"" was used by the international coalition leaders in the war against Daesh, as a symbol of the UAE armed forces soldiers and officers' valor and the impact they created in this war despite the small size of the country. The film also narrates the history of UAE's participation in peacekeeping operations, defense of world peace and security, and humanitarian relief operations, documented by events and photos and highlighting the pivotal role played by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces in supporting and sponsoring development and progress the UAE military establishment over 30 years in all fields. Along the same line, and in a special chapter, the film documents the UAE participation in the Saudi-led Operation Decisive Storm to support the legitimate authorities in Yemen, and the role of its wise leadership of His Majesty Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud. The script also highlighted the humanitarian and national aspects of this war through showing expressive moments about the visits made by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan and his brothers the Sheikhs to the mourning majlis to offer condolences to the families of the Emirati martyrs, which highlights the unity between the leadership and citizens to affirm their solidarity, as well their visits to the wounded and injured Armed Forces servicemen who have shown courage, patriotism, and dedication to their home country and leadership. The film closes with highlighting some facts that the UAE's belief was built on since its creation at the hands of the late Sheikh Zayed Al Nahyan up to the empowerment phase under the wise leadership of His Highness Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan - President of the UAE. What makes the UAE unique, according to current and former U.S. military officials, is a combination of great oil wealth, which has allowed the country to buy advanced weapons and fund extensive training programs, and a willingness to put its personnel and equipment in harm's way by participating in coalition operations. As a tiny nation on the Arabian Peninsula comprising seven sometimes-fractious emirates led by different royal families, the UAE could have opted to go the way of other small countries in its neighborhood by building a modest military focused on domestic security and instead turning to the regional powerhouse - Saudi Arabia - for protection from Iran and other external threats. But Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, the emirate that manages the country's defense and foreign policy, did not want to be beholden to the Saudis. It was part pragmatism, part pride: As the UAE has become more prosperous - not just through oil, but also as a regional hub for commerce and finance - Zayed has sought to build an equally influential military that can project power well beyond its borders. The UAE's enthusiasm to attack the Islamic State is rooted in the government's zero-tolerance policy toward Islamic militancy. Although home-grown extremist groups do not appear to pose much of a threat to the leadership in Abu Dhabi - the country possess an extensive and aggressive internal-security service - Emirati officials are concerned that civil wars in Syria, Libya and other parts of the Arab world threatens their stability and prosperity.",English,United Arab Emirates,1 nomination,N/A,13,tt5818206,N/A

Clydebuilt: The Ships That Made the Commonwealth,2014–,N/A,N/A,Documentary,N/A,N/A,David Hayman,"HMS Hood, a British battleship, was the pride of the Navy. It had been launched in 1918 and had seen no combat but had sailed around to British colonies showing the flag for twenty years, a public icon. She was old but powerful and efficient and carried a symbolic charge. The Hood's chief weakness was her deck armor. There was plenty of steel around her hull, useful in containing damage from torpedoes or flat fire. But over the years naval weaponry had evolved.Unlike the pirate ships of the movies, ships no longer had to be close to each other to do damage. Shells could be fired from miles away. This took the shells into a high trajectory so when they reached the target they were coming down at an extreme angle. This was called ""plunging fire"" and made the decks vulnerable. Realizing this, the British halted the Hood's construction midway and armored the forward part of her deck. The armor wasn't extended aft for fear of cutting down the ship's speed with the extra weight.The German battleship, KMS Bismark, was newer, launched in 1939, and was the most powerful warship afloat at the time, along with her sister ship, Tirpitz. But the Bismark was more than just an instrument of war. It was beautiful in its lines and overall design. Bismark looked as if she had been built by an architect who happened also to be an engineer. She carried eight 15-inch guns that fired a shell weighing nearly half a ton at almost twice the speed of sound. She also had superior optical instruments and fire control.Bismark slipped out of port and into the north Atlantic, a major threat to the convoys from North America that were quite literally Britain's lifeline. Bismark and the heavy cruiser, Prince Eugen, were spotted and pursued by Hood and the new, untried battleship, Prince of Wales. Hood's Captain Holland knew about the problem with his weak deck armor and, finally catching up to the enemy, proceeded at flank speed to close the range and avoid plunging fire.But now the problem was that since Hood and Prince of Wales were heading directly for the target, only their forward guns could be used, while Bismark was able to fire broadsides with all of her guns. This and other details were omitted from the popular British feature film, ""Sink the Bismark."" Holland had almost reached the point at which he was safe enough from plunging fire to turn broadside and engage all of his guns, but he began the turn a few seconds too late.The Bismark fired a salvo that had to travel about ten miles and did so in only thirty seconds. One of the shells apparently struck the underarmored rear deck covering the magazines. The Hood blew up with a tremendous explosion, began to sink immediately, and took almost all her crew with her. There were three survivors, only one now left alive, Ted Briggs.It's an epic story, filled with tragedy and eventual triumph. It's periodically interrupted by one of those ""discovery"" expeditions that the Titanic was subjected to a few years ago. I suppose if you're an experienced oceanographer you know what you're looking at and are thrilled by it. To at least one viewer, namely me, they all look pretty much the same, like some moss-hung haunted mansion in Louisiana after it has been blitzed by the Civil War.The first half of the film is mostly narrated historical newsreel and combat footage. There are reenactors and some workable visual effects. The last twenty minutes are touching but a little out of synch with the story itself. The expensive project was funded by Britain's Channel 4.

In 2011, experts and scientists from around the world gathered in Toronto, Canada to present new and established evidence that questions the official story of 9/11. This evidence was presented to a distinguished panel of experts over a four day period. Through their analysis and scientific investigations, they hope to spark a new investigation into the attacks of September 11, 2001. Featuring expert witness testimony from: David Ray Griffin, Richard Gage, David Chandler, Kevin Ryan, Niels Harrit, Barbara Honegger, Peter Dale Scott, Graeme MacQueen, Jonathan Cole, Cynthia McKinney and many more.

Housewives who feel they are overwhelmed with raising children, workers who feel they are powerless and cannot get ahead, people feeling trapped, paralyzed and unbalanced in their daily lives. Socio-economic pressures abound in our ""advanced,"" modern day society and beneath the surface of humanity many of us are nervous and afraid as we are expected to portray, uphold and obey an illusion of civilization that does not resemble the world in which we actually traffic. As a result to the mounting pressures, many people have turned to drugs to cope with their lives, only to destroy the life they are trying to sustain. This has led to an increase in the use and abuse of hard drugs such as Heroin. Millions of Americans aged 12 or older have used heroin at least once in their lives. Research reveals that a significant percentage of individuals who use heroin become dependent on it. The war on drugs has had little effect on actual drug use.

They were seen as Gods by primitive man and worshipped. They set themselves apart and yet some mated with humans and created a special race. When these watchers departed, this hybrid species remained and taught mankind. Civilization emerged with writing, art, science, mathematics, geometry, engineering, architecture and more and spread around the globe. The human race, that had existed for tens of thousands of years as hunter gatherers now had systematic knowledge on a startling level. They organized and cultivated the land, forged steel, built massive pyramids, built empires, and eventually became so technologically bound that the entire race could be monitored and governed with ease. All this transpired seemingly out of nowhere, we do not see archaeological evidence to support the evolution of these staggering advancements but can link it all back to antiquity if we look carefully because the real story is that our benefactors had an ulterior motive. They took control of our hearts and minds; they control this world, they control every individual from the depths of outer space. From the moment you are born, you are numbered and moved through a process to feed their machine. Nobody is truly free because we are all working for the masters. On rare occasions, they are revealed to the world and in the 18th century we had a glimpse of their massive power. We know them as the Illuminati. From huge international corporations, to hidden governments, from secret societies to medicine, the Illuminati are in control.

It was manipulated by masters of propaganda and the arcane arts. The result was the deaths of millions of people. The men behind this massive scheme were members of the most evil and vile of political parties ever to have existed. We know them as the Nazis. Their purpose was to bring about the rise of a so-called Aryan race, a race that would rule the world for a thousand years. This would be their 3rd Reich. To accomplish this nefarious grand scheme, they needed to eradicate certain races from the globe and subjugate others, as well as needing millions of people to believe and follow only them. And so they created a messiah, a god on Earth. His name was Adolf Hitler and he would become the greatest master of manipulating the hearts and souls of mankind in recorded history. From mass hypnosis to blatant propaganda, from control of the media, to eradicating the opposition, all methods were employed. This is the story of how that apocalyptic agenda was brought to fruition and the methods used to control the minds of men, women and children. This is the story of Nazi Propaganda.

Based on real life incidents ,the film is a stirring saga. Focusing on life in a tiny feudal village in Maharashtra, the plot of the film begins with 'Samba' being married to 'Parvi'. Later,he finds his younger sibling 'Mallapa' is attracted to her. His wife makes love to the younger brother .They are caught in the act by the elder brother.There is public humiliation. But after a Panchayat hearing , a match is arranged and she is declared married to both the brothers since that is what she deems fit.There is a sub plot of greed and avarice in which 'Kasha' tries to reign supremacy in a Machiavellian way. The film resonates with the theme of India's culture and socio-politics wherein morality is given greater emphasis. The personal is unashamedly public. The sexuality of a woman has been put forth in a very unassuming way by the wife in her role. Parvi is married to two men and is attracted both of them. There is nothing unnatural or grotesque in this act. She needs both the brothers for her peace and happiness. But will the village permit a woman to have her freedom. Nat Khel's end portrays the subjugation of women in our country wherein they have to time and again prove their womanhood. It reveals the noxious elements of patriarchy which are prevalent in our society.",Marathi,India,N/A,N/A,N/A,tt5821346,N/A

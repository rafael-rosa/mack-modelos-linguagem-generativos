Once they are reunited again in Helsinki, Herr Baron discovers that Madame Vasilevna earns her living with a new hobby: she likes very much painting frozen Finn landscapes but especially the ones around military bases.""Korkein Voitto"" ( The Highest Triumph ) was directed by Herr Carl von Haartman in the silent year of 1929 and it was the first film directed by this peculiar Finnish director, although previously Herr Haartman had a very interesting life and career.During his youthful days, Herr Haartman had a military career and he participated in the Finnish civil war of 1918. During the mid 20's he went to Hollywood where he collaborated or played with very important directors of the time, namely Herr William Wellman with whom Herr Haartman, a military expert, supervised every flying sequence of ""Wings"" (1927) and Herr Erich von Stroheim's ""The Wedding March"" (1928) wherein Haartman played what is supposed to be a German officer, a role that was his speciality during his acting days in Hollywood (though he was often un-credited).With such important film background experience, Herr Haartman was selected by the most important Finland film studio, ""Suomi-Filmi"" to direct ""Korkein Voitto"" and certainly the Hollywood experience can be appreciated in the impeccable and excellent film direction. The art direction and cinematography demonstrate an appreciation for film classicism, a high finish film made by a Finnish director, ja wohl!.Herr Haartman has a fluid film narrative ( travelling, air scenes ) constructing a story of romance and political schemes in which stereotypes are used proportionally and in a light way ( an idle Baron, a mysterious woman, a suspicious Jew, an expensive taxi driver? ) adding action and a slight sense of humour, achieving finally a very interesting although uneven film.The main characters of the picture, Herr Baron und Madame Vasilevna, played by Herr Haartman himself und Frau Kerstin Nylander, go all over Finland, combining in this way urban scenes together with others of the wild and frozen Finnish landscapes (there's even some seal hunting, a peculiar pastime for Finns). The dramatic intensity of this story of hidden intrigues works well, even though the characters are rather clichéd.

Nina ja Erik, Tarkas' first movie of the year, strives to be a serious drama about young people's restlessness, but has lost some of its effect over the years.The first thing we see is a trial where two young men called Erik Vaara and Heikki Korte (Martti Katajisto and Ville-Veikko Salminen) are sentenced to prison and a young woman Nina Swahn (Pirkko Mannola) to probation. Nina goes on to have a discussion with Erik's father (Tauno Palo), prompting several flashbacks to illustrate how things became what they are: Nina and Erik are originally frustrated with their wealthy parents when meeting each other in the countryside and quickly fall in love with each other. However, Erik's thinly veiled anger toward his father and jealousy to Nina's tough ex-boyfriend Heikki a.k.a. Hessu cause things to develop into a dangerous direction.The always lovely Pirkko Mannola is clearly the highlight of the movie that otherwise often seems overly serious and pompous; I just wish her character had been written more diverse than the always positive sidekick for the men that she is now. The laughably overage Martti Katajisto (in his thirties!) is anything but convincing as the brooding young man barely out of his teens whose menacing fits of anger are supposed to drive the plot forward, but do so way too slowly to be interesting. The young couple's romantic strolling on a beach and in a forest cabin could technically be fitting in a more atmospheric film, but here they feel prolonged and even dull in spite of Pirkko Mannola's charisma and skimpy swimsuits. Tauno Palo also comes across as rather stiff as Erik's father. Still, the cool Ville-Veikko Salminen is funny as the car-stealing bad boy Hessu, intentionally or not.Furthermore, the heavy-handed style is emphasized by the dramatic and frequently sentimental score. Even though Nina ja Erik is not completely hopeless, it would have really needed a more relaxed attitude to the subject matter to work well as a portrayal of young people's emotional turmoil – the building blocks of the story just don't fall into place here. I would only recommend this one to the biggest Pirkko Mannola fans; she even gets to sing one little song during a party scene.",Finnish,Finland,1 nomination,5.5,68,tt0138656,N/A
Niskavuoren Aarne,1954,N/A,91 min,Drama,Edvin Laine,"Pentti Unho, Hella Wuolijoki","Elsa Turakainen, Tauno Palo, Rauni Ikäheimo","The Finnish Niskavuori series is a family saga at its best and portrays some of the best actor and actress performances, but you could expect as much with one the best Finnish directors, Edwin Laine. It's a shame that movies like these do not get world-wide distribution, because they deserve it, but the language barrier is one very big obstacle. The powerful storytelling of the Niskavuori series was created by Hella Wuolijoki who portrayed the times, customs and people the way they were.The Niskavuori family always had strong women and weak men, whether they were born into the family or married to it. The women were patient, wise and ran the business affairs being definitely the corner stone of the family, while men had affairs, drank or otherwise didn't prove to have the spine to keep the family together.Aarne was one such male character. Instead of wanting to continue the tradition of running the family farm, he had an affair with a teacher, left his wife and moved to he city with the teacher. Anything like that was a scandal in those days. Later, of course, he returned back to the farm, which again was a manifestation of the strong attachment to land and tradition that Finnish people share.Edwin Laine also directed a remake of the movie, I think it was in the 80's, which was just as good as the original. The drama preserved its originality and somehow didn't seem like ""the old days,"" though the movie was of course still set in the same era.",Finnish,Finland,1 win,6.1,120,tt0138657,N/A

Olli's Apprenticeship,1920,N/A,91 min,Drama,Teuvo Puro,"Teuvo Puro, Anni Swan","Antti Ilvos, Jussi Snellman, Ertta Virtamo","Herr Teuvo Puro is considered in his native Finland as their most remarkable silent film pioneer; he was one of the founders of two important Finnish production film companies, ""Suomi-Filmi"" ( Finland's oldest film company ) und ""Komedia-Filmi""; Herr Puro's relatively short career began in 1907 when he directed the first Finnish silent feature, ""Salaviinanpolttajat,"" unfortunately a lost film. Herr Puro also directed ""Sylvi"" (1913) of which 13 minutes are still extant, making it the oldest surviving Finnish film. In 1920, Puro directed ""Ollin Oppivuodet"" which was the first feature film to be produced after Finland become an independent country in 1917; so, as you can see, Herr Puro's film career set many milestones.""Ollin Oppivuodet"" ( Olli's Apprenticeship ) was based on Frau Anni Swan's eponymous and popular children's novel and its premiere was a huge and remarkable event attended by the Finnish president and many members of government ( However, no aristocrats were in attendance)The film depicts the story of Kinder Olli, a rascal who runs away from home fearing a terrible spanking from his father due to his continual bad behaviour. Ollin's cousin, Herr Kaarle, owner of the deteriorated Harmaala Manor, later finds the child wandering alone and decides to take him in, encouraged by Herr Kaarle's aunt, Frau Matleena. However they are motivated by greed not compassion as they pretend that the boy has drowned, making Herr Karrle the only heir to the Koivumäki Manor, which primarily belongs to Olli. The two conspirators disguise Olli as a girl and spirit him away to Sweden where he is apprenticed to the shoemaker Herr Simolin.""Ollin Oppivuodet"" can be described ( although this Herr Graf hasn't read the original Frau Swan novel since it was written in Finnish? ) as a film with Dickensian overtones and atmosphere, playing like a classical newspaper serial story that includes the usual elements meant to touch and move the audience: poor little rich boys, poverty, misfortunes, orphan girls, a number of scoundrels but with everything turning OK in the end. The contrast of riches and poverty is very well done and the social conditions are depicted in a realistic manner. Olli has many mishaps, including a disastrous attempt to become a sailor with his friend Ränni-Pelle and later ending up in an institution, accused of robbery. Every episode is perfectly performed by the two young actors, as naïf as their characters. In spite of difficulties and misfortunes, a message of hope prevails. The film does suffer from a lack of rhythm and continuity but the classical literary inspiration and the period atmosphere make up for that and the film avoids excessive sentimentality and tear jerking. And now, if you'll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must continue with his apprenticeship to a bon vivant.",None,Finland,N/A,6.2,81,tt0138674,N/A

Perheen musta lammas,1941,N/A,90 min,Comedy,Jorma Nortimo,"Jorma Nortimo, Melita Tång","Sirkka Sipilä, Eino Kaipainen, Joel Rinne","Years 1939-45 were dark years in all of Europe, including Finland which suffered from two devastating wars with the Soviet Union during those years. The political situation also affected the cinema of Finland more or less directly; of the movies produced in those years, many were lightweight comedies aimed to cheer people up while avoiding sensitive political subjects. One such rom-com is Jorma Nortimo's Perheen musta lammas from early 1941, the Interim Peace era.A man in women's clothes has been a staple of the comedy genre for who knows how long, but the joke works the other way round too. Perheen musta lammas is the story of an orphaned office worker named Raili Wirma (Sirkka Sipilä) who moves into her own apartment from the custody of her three oppressive aunts. Soon she finds herself deep in debt and breaks up with her boyfriend Topi (director Nortimo), but gets an idea when she accidentally gets a job as an errand boy while being dressed as a guy for laughs. In order to make money for her creditors, she tries to maintain several false identities in different jobs – easier said than done.The humour is not highly imaginative, but there are many amusing details in the movie anyway. Sipilä looks funny as a boy and pretty as a girl and certain supporting characters are fun too, for example Siiri Angerkoski as Raili's uncle's wife Salli (a former opera diva) and the trio of Raili's conservative aunts (Elsa Turakainen, Verna Piponius and Henny Valjus) who complete each other's sentences like Huey, Dewey and Louie in classic Donald Duck comics. Some cinematic techniques are more interesting than in many average old Finn-films: the surreal dream sequence and the clothes-changing scene in a moving elevator look cool, as does the semi-long take introducing the beauty parlour where Raili finds a job under a false name. Some moments are also a bit more risqué than expected from a movie of the era.Nevertheless, I don't think the romantic plot lines work as well as the identity-related ones. Raili has three men trying to woo her, but the final relationship feels like an obligatory happy ending instead of a natural part of the story. Even so, Raili herself is an interesting character thanks to her openness to shady methods like stealing and deceiving in order to reach her goals. Still, she too has to taste her own medicine when an artist named Rautia (Joel Rinne) blackmails her into becoming a nude model for him. This plot detail in particular is actually surprisingly dark considering the rom-com premise, but in the end everything is resolved with no hard feelings, of course. I doubt a similar joke could be done in a modern comedy without accusations of sexism – attitudes do change over time.In any case, as a whole I thought the movie is somewhat watchable and entertaining little comedy. It is not Jorma Nortimo's best film and I think funnier movies have been made in Finland and elsewhere, but if nothing else is on, Perheen musta lammas makes an alright pastime for 90 minutes.",Finnish,Finland,N/A,5.1,50,tt0138700,N/A

Divided into three parts, each is really less original than the next.It is not that it is painful to watch, by no means. It is at times quite entertaining, especially the third part which focuses on a bunch of students getting stuck on their way to the disco. But the film offers the viewer little, somehow I had a hard time believing that the teenagers had had such rough lives, considering that they all looked like they came from a perfectly good family. The struggles which they face are minor and outbursts come from nowhere.More glamorous than 'Kids' which seemed somewhat more raw than this piece. Uninspired filmmaking which seemed to hope controversy would erupt in making it, but it has all been done before, and it is not shocking to watch the kids do what they are doing.",German,Austria,2 wins & 1 nomination total,6.1,49,tt0139013,N/A

However, as the wedding day approaches, an unwelcome figure from Anna-Liisa's past returns to her little village: Herr Mikko, her old boyfriend. Herr Mikko, with the help of his wicked mother, tells Frau Anna-Liisa that unless she marries him, he will reveal an awful secret she has hidden for years.""Anna-Liisa"" was directed in the silent year of 1922 by Herr Teuvo Puro together with Herr Jussi Snellman. It was the first Finnish feature to be sold abroad and was seen in countries like Norway, Sweden, France and even the United States.The film is based on a play by Frau Minna Canth who was a very important Finnish writer and a champion of women's rights, a pioneer and combative Nordic feminist, ja wohl! This is reflected in the powerful and impressive feminine portrait of Anna-Liisa, tormented but valiant and determined, a woman who will decide her own fate, threats and coercion aside. She is excellently played by the actress Frau Helmi Lindelöf.The dramatic and intense story of the film is equal to other Nordic rural dramas of those early silent times, such as those directed by masters like Herr Victor Sjöström and Herr Mauritz Stiller. Like them Herr Puro invokes nature as part of the dramatic development of the story. A flashback shows Frau Anna-Liisa's terrible deed which involves a hideous taboo that is still shocking nowadays. Still, there is atonement and Frau Anna-Liisa accepts responsibility for her past and consequently decides her future. Herr Puro brilliantly blends indoor sets which suggest the theater with the naturalism of the exterior scenes.And now, if you'll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must confess an aristocratic trifle of the past to one of his Teutonic fat and rich heiresses.Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com",None,Finland,N/A,6.4,101,tt0139024,N/A

In Simon's eyes, his high-powered businessman father Matt wasted no time in remarrying his stepmother Lauren, a woman with a perfect facade whom he suspects of having an affair with Matt long before his mother's demise. When Simon is sent away to boarding school in preparation to attend Princeton, he meets Andrew, who introduces him to marijuana and LSD, and immerses him into a whole new world populated by dreamers, artists, utopians, flower children and partiers who spend the better part of their lives ""on tour"" at musical festivals. Simon is deeply moved by the beauty and freedom of these people, and feels they are the family he has always sought. At his very first concert Simon meets Jennifer, a beautiful young hippie to whom he is immediately attracted, Trace, a hipster on the road less traveled who immediately bonds with him, and Kevin, a champion of the ""seize the day"" ethic who is dying of AIDS. As Simon delves deeper into this new-found free-spirited lifestyle, he must face an inevitable conflict not only with the life his father has planned for him, but also with the self-destructive emotional turmoil deep within. Struggling to come to terms with these conflicts, Simon makes a series of bad decisions which land him in a strict drug rehab program run by a street-smart, yet caring woman named Kate.

At a brothel we see a whore sucking 2 cocks at once, when Maria Arnold knocks on her door. Sarah and Carey decide to go west with Lil (Arnold) while one girl stays behind to watch the house.Lil and her girls arrive to service 4 horny miners.

Next guy gets busty redhead Sarah, accompanied by a pirated Ennio Morricone Western score on the soundtrack. Jed humps a fourth girl Jenny (a pretty brunette) in a tent, as a whistling version of ""Streets of Laredo"" plays.

Our protagonist is lodge member Bert Williams, described as a ""walking delegate,"" who is clearly in arrears with both the saloon's barkeep, Hostetter Johnson, and with the lodge itself. Early on, he is compelled to remit the dues he owes (three dollars), which he does reluctantly. [Some prints of the film omit the next sequence: After leaving a meeting with his friend Limpy Jones, who is handicapped with gout and must ride on Bert's shoulders, Bert passes a graveyard where he overhears two chicken thieves splitting up their takings, saying ""One for you, an' one for me."" He and Limpy are convinced that they have overheard devils splitting up their souls, and flee in a panic; Bert actually pushing the crippled man over in his haste to run away. Limpy makes his way alone back to the saloon and tells the others about the frightening experience. Bert, meanwhile, encounters the thieves on the road and pieces together what really happened. He invites the thieves to accompany him back to the saloon, where Limpy is made to look foolish. Then Bert and Limpy appropriate the thieves' stolen chickens, and eject the men from their company.] Bert attempts to win back his recently-paid three dollars from the club's treasurer in a dice game, but Brother Scott interrupts and forces them to depart-- meanwhile pocketing the money they left behind. After Brother Scott exits, a sporty young man, Cicero Sampson, flashes a wad of bills he apparently won gambling, up north. Bert, impressed, challenges Sampson to a game of poker. A lookout is posted in front of the saloon. Bert wins Sampson's bank roll and his pocket watch-- by cheating, with Limpy's assistance unfortunately, just at his moment of triumph, cops bust the place and arrest all the players. Brother Scott represents the group in court, and seems to have a very friendly relationship with the judge. The judge orders that the spoils of the game go to Brother Scott, as his fee. He orders Cicero Sampson to leave town within three days, and sentences Bert to ten days in jail. In jail, Bert dreams of a poker game he plays by himself, with phantom opponents. He cuts the invisible deck and deals.",None,United States,N/A,5.4,163,tt0139488,N/A

Sanam,1951,N/A,N/A,"Comedy, Drama, Romance",Nandlal Jaswantlal,N/A,"Dev Anand, Suraiya, Meena Kumari","Sanam is another Dev Anand and Suraiya movie made late 1940's and early 1950's when Dev Anand was an upcoming star and Suraiya was already an established actress. Meena Kumari plays a very insignificant role, in fact this is one of the movies where she was breaking into general acting role from her mythological characters. Sanam is about a love story where Jogin ( Dev Anand ) a very poor unemployed young man comes across Sadhana ( Suraiya ) in a chance encounter in a book shop. Under desperate conditions Jogin had to rob some money for his mother's treatment and got involved in an accidental homicide for which he was jailed by the court where the Judge ( K.N. Singh ) is the father of Sadhana. The story takes many twists and turn with a few very melodious songs and a dance number and eventually Jogin and Sadhana fall for each other but their proposed marriage is vehemently opposed by the father of the bride. Suraiya provided with a solid performance as the independent minded daughter and did not hesitate to argue with her father about social justice for the poor and under privileged. Gope provided good supporting role with his antics. Overall it was a good movie to watch specially Suraiya's great performance both as an actor and for singing some melodious songs with the direction of Husanlal Bhagatram. The movie was directed by Nandalal Jaswantal who also gave us the block busters like Nagin and Anarkali. I graded the movie as a seven out of ten.",Hindi,India,N/A,6.9,24,tt0139583,N/A

Strange Family Mix.,1977,X,59 min,Adult,N/A,N/A,"Bobby Astyr, Clea Carson, Veri Knotty","Since porn is traditionally based on a ""forbidden fruit"" principle (though in recent decades it is so omnipresent as to make that notion silly), a certain number of determinedly disreputable films are made to titillate the ""I've seen it all"" segment of a jaded audience. This incest entry succeeds in the gross-out department.Very crudely shot, with some of the most abysmal ad libbing I've seen in ages, this loser builds listlessly to an orgy party scene involving an extended family (at the cousins level) for pseudo-incest, but carrying zero weight. Incest is a fascinating cinematic topic, since the challenge is to put the viewer into the minds &amp; attitudes of the participants in the incestuous act, and how their society will treat them. That is totally absent here as everything is a goof, as when Bobby Astyr as Uncle Wayne ""accidentally"" has sex with his niece early on at a massage parlor.Trying to be naughty is often silly in this movie: one example is a sex scene where clothes pins are attached to the girl's nipples for the fun of it, or at the orgy where a weird ""inflation"" device is inserted into a bespectacled girl's vagina in what I thought was going to be an enema scene. I guess enigmatic is better than enematic.After the big &amp; dull orgy, punctuated by the cast having some laughing fits, the family decides to make a pact not to tell anyone about their misbehavior. The girls seal the pact by drinking semen that's been carefully collected in a tumbler, while the guys have their penises pierced (it looks real in bloody closeup shots) to do a blood-brother type ritual.

City Under Siege,1974,N/A,114 min,"Crime, Drama",Romolo Guerrieri,"Mino Roli, Nico Ducci, Riccardo Marcato","Enrico Maria Salerno, Françoise Fabian, Luciano Salce","Yet another offbeat poliziottesco, this is actually an interesting satire ? again centred around a particular Italian metropolis, Turin. Here, rather than having a tough young cop fighting gangsters or petty criminals, we get Enrico Maria Salerno as a middle-aged intellectual Police Commissioner who finds that the biggest threat comes from the city's decadent aristocracy (eventually exposing a drug/prostitution racket). His fine performance is matched by Francoise Fabian as the beautiful widowed mother of one of the suspects (with whom he shares a hesitant relationship) and film director Luciano Salce as a cynical and alcoholic crusading newspaperman (and Salerno's longtime associate).Still, the film's tone is undecided (alternating brusquely between broad comedy and heavy drama) and the narrative all over the place ? encompassing not only Salerno's own failing health but industrial politics (in the figure of a crazed ex-FIAT employee) and the problems of immigrants (an irrelevant but moving sequence in which a young boy hangs himself because of poor grades at school and where Salerno tries to break the ice by communicating with the befuddled father in their native dialect). All the while, it also attempts to fulfill the requirements of the genre by depicting a hold-up at a jewellery which leaves the elderly owner dead, the rape/murder of a teenage girl, a train robbery which turns into a massacre of both cops and criminals, the attempted suicide of Fabian's son over a frame-up, the climactic raid on the brothel, etc.Ultimately, the film is overlong though it concludes with a couple of strong sequences: Salerno and Salce disrupting a social gathering by distributing pornographic material to the clearly embarrassed (but ever polite) aristocracy depicting their degenerate offsprings, and Salerno angrily showing Fabian the 'real' Turin ? a city vaunted for its medieval relics, and to whose hedonism Salerno maintains the people are slowly reverting! Carlo Rustichelli's jaunty music often serves as ironic commentary on the proceedings but, for this reason, doesn't have the urgency of the typical poliziottesco score.",Italian,Italy,N/A,6.3,108,tt0139691,N/A

"Vatsa sisään, rinta ulos!",1959,N/A,91 min,Comedy,Aarne Tarkas,Aarne Tarkas,"Helge Herala, Tommi Rinne, Marjatta Kallio","After seeing Vatsa sisään, rinta ulos! by Aarne Tarkas one can but compare it to Some like it hot by Billy Wilder. Similarities between these two films are striking as both of them belong to the same category of cross-dressing comedy and what more fascinating, both of the titles are from the same year (1959). The first one shows us a current (1950s) world of girls' school and garrison in an idyllic Finnish town whereas the latter one allows history to soften themes a bit. In both films there are three major characters: two men whose masculinity is under review, and a woman, who is like a sexual angel.In Wilder's film the distinction between two major male character is shown as possibility to change the identity role, and Some like it hot even gives us a great laugh of a couple of millionaire and transvestite (""woman""), while in Tarkas' farce the much greater fear of homosexuality is handled quite openly. The transvestite theme is only like a token idiom. Happy end is more open in Wilder's film than in Tarkas' as the main characters end up in opposite possibilities: in first one impossible end and in second one totally accepted, but obviously most improbable.Both films include musical elements, but very different ways: Wilder puts music to be an integral part of his masterpiece while Tarkas uses some popular singers in his title without any need. I mean that music in this Finnish farce could be better in few moments, but otherwise all the things seems to fit rarely well. Tarkas' Vatsa sisään, rinta ulos! gives us excellent characters - perhaps even more than Wilder in his film -, and marvellously played. Helge Herala's neurotic officer also allows us allusions of Hynkel from Charles Chaplin's The great dictator...Surprisingly good, if we forget the overage schoolgirls and like that.

The plot, such as it is, revolves around Vihtori's clandestine involvement with an attractive and rather worldly young woman named Ritva, who is planning to marry boxing champion and garage owner Klasu Tullari, son of Vihtori's friend Tomi, and their interactions with daughter Vappu and her fiancé, Peter von Schaslick, a mechanic in Klasu's garage, under the nose of the threatening and suspicious Klaara, with lazy son Nisse acting as a rather sardonic Greek chorus.The film makes hilarious use of a number of situations and set-ups taken directly from McManus's comic strips, opening with the sound of crashing crockery as Klaara attempts to coerce a reluctant Vihtori into accompanying her to the opera. Vihtori's carousing and late nights out with the boys, Klaara's penchant for wielding an over-sized rolling pin, Vihtori's hair-raising descent down knotted bed sheets from an upper-story apartment, Klaara's piano playing and atrocious singing, and Vihtori's humiliation by the neighborhood kids while walking Klaara's minuscule dog, Pipi, are all faithfully recreated from gags first portrayed in McManus's strip.Vihtori ja Klaara has just been released on DVD in Finland, and has English subtitles, but you'll probably need a DVD player that can play European discs if you plan on adding it to your collection.",Finnish,Finland,N/A,5.2,101,tt0139719,N/A

Subsequent shows showed a man doing an impression of Charles de Gaulle using only his penis (resulting in the almost unique warning before the show 'This programme contains very strong language and close-up, full-frontal male nudity) and Sadowitz introducing the show with an Indian accent and a turban saying 'Are there any taboos left in comedy?' Sadowitz is one of the most brilliant comedians on the planet, but, of all the ones I've seen- and I've seen hundreds on both sides of the Atlantic- this Scottish/Jewish comedian is the most offensive. The question that must be askes is whether this is revolutionary or merely shock for shock's sake.

The Please Watch the Jon Lovitz Special,1992,N/A,30 min,Comedy,Don Mischer,"Jon Lovitz, Alan Zweibel","Mel Allen, Carol Alt, Army Archerd","This half hour special (it's title declares it a ""show"", was this supposed to be a pilot?) was a goof on the Playhouse 90 genre, (i.e.) a play is filmed live on stage and broadcast. The difference being, what with this a Lovitz comedy special, he is lampooning himself and the genre. What would you call this, a mockudrama? At any rate, the episode had a sort of Damn Yankees feel to it. It centered on a baseball player, something about if he slides into home he will die from an old head injury, and, naturally, he must make up his mind at the end of the play whether or not to slide headfirst into home to win the game. He does and I can't remember what happens, which pretty much sums up this show. Which is not to say the show didn't have it's moments. At the top of the show Lovitz tells a row of illustrious directors, Rob Reiner, Ron Underwood, et. al., that if they see anything they like during the play simply pick up the phone in front of them and it would ring a phone on the stage. During dramatic moments Lovitz would gesture to the directors and the phone. When the phone would ring, it was always to offer work to someone other than Lovitz. The thing was loaded with stars and for the life of me I couldn't figure out who was able to swing that. I remember a gag where Alex Rocco is shot through the glasses ala The Godfather and his last words are ""Not the other eye"", then they cut away to Duvall and Caan in the audience, high fiving. The concept was really strange, and I like strange, but this just didn't work. It had it's moments now and then, Lovitz is a funny guy after all, but he strikes out here. Interesting how they list all the actors as themselves. As I recall they almost all played characters in the play.

Magic Matches,1914,N/A,N/A,"Short, Comedy",Émile Cohl,N/A,N/A,"This rare Emile Cohl animation is not so rare as it used to be: it can be found on the Europa Film Treasure site.It's another typically untypical Emile Cohl work, owing as much to stop-motion animation as straight cartooning, with a lot of abstract figures and sketches done with matchsticks. It's also a stream-of-consciousness non-narrative as the figures transform from one to another, with intermissions of pipes, cigars and finally cigarettes. Cohl worked absurdly fast in an era before the Bray patents or rotoscoping. His only real competition was Winsor MacKay, who produced one cartoon every few years. It would be another year before Raoul Barre entered the fray with THE ARTIST'S DREAM and another two years before he began his regular series for Edison with THE ANIMATED GROUCH CHASER. Eventually the history of cartoons would proceed from Barre's work, and Cohl's work would be an interesting early bypath in their evolution.

He is a watchmaker, she is a prostitute who has bonded herself to two-years work in a brothel so that her family back in Russia can have some money. The relationship is more akin to a father- daughter one than a sexual one, but the threads of Raskolnikov's romance in ""Crime and Punishment"" exist in the minds of both of the key players.

For this Pandian sells his bike and gives the money to him but still there is a shortage of money. Finally Pandian becomes Avvai Shanmugi and he goes for the interview in a Ladies bus, but Nagesh says that he make up stays only for 5 hours.

To find the truth Sethuraman Iyer follows her and he gets caught with Muthaliyar(Manivannan), who was also in love with Avvai Shanmugi. Seeing this he beats Sethuraman Iyer and by this time Avvai Shanmugi now comes as Pandian and he rescues Sethuraman Iyer and says to mudhaliar that Sethuraman Iyer was the husband of Avvai Shanmugi. Pandian says a different story to Sethuraman Iyer that Mudhaliyar was the husband of Avvai Shanmugi. Similary when all the members of Vishwanathan Iyer goes to a jwellery shop, Joseph comes there and he was asking money from Avvai Shanmigi. Watching this Vishwanathan Iyer questions Shanmugi who it was and she says thet it was her husband so she could escape from the situation. So Vishwanathan Iyer says that he will give money so that he should leave Avvai Shanmugi and Joseph who was money oriented accepts the offer and during this time Sethuraman Iyer comes in and says he isn't the husband but Mudhaliyar was the husband of Avvai Shanmugi, but Joseph somehow manages the situation.

Die Brüder Noltenius,1945,N/A,87 min,Drama,Gerhard Lamprecht,"Fritz Gray, Richard H. Riedel, Frank Thieß","Willy Birgel, Karl Mathias, Hilde Weissner","Both Filmportal and Wikipedia give the date of the opening as April 7, 1945. This makes Noltenius Brothers quite special - as the last of the twelve German films which received its premiere between January 1 and the capitulation of Germany on May 7, 1945. To be precise, another film - Via Mala - received it's first public showing on the same day (in the small town of Mayrhofen, where the filming took place, but no longer made it to the cinemas until 1948). So, exactly one month before Day Zero, there was a good day for German cinema.The Noltenius Brothers is exactly what you would imagine it to be: very serious, sombre, dignified; a story about honor and duty and responsibility. Everything is played out indoors (as it was, by the late 1944, rather difficult to film anything outdoors and still try to hide the fact there's a war on), in an old patrician household, which serves as a reminder of an era that would be gone forever any moment. It's a ""modern"" film (meaning the action supposedly takes place in the present), but the whole story-line would have worked better, had the setting been changed to say, late 1800s - we get a bunch of very dignified gentlemen of the town council having very dignified meetings; at home there is a rather boring mousey little hausfrau, supposedly torn by some inner emotions when meeting again 'the other brother' whom she did not marry some twenty years ago. What makes it interesting, is, of course, the fact that we are seeing 1945 - but a warped, fun-house mirror version of that year, where there is no war, people are dancing and lingering in deep thoughts at the grand pianos, as if in a frozen dream. The atmosphere is similar to Opfergang (1944), in itself a much more interesting film (and in color).This poor film only managed to stay in cinemas (those, that were still standing) for a week or so, as the battle for Berlin with it's brutal door-to-door combat began the very next week. So I believe that for many warn-torn people in Berlin, who were never sure if they would live to see the next morning, this must have been their final escape room from the grim realities outside.",German,Germany,N/A,7.4,16,tt0139904,N/A

The hand rapidly outlines a human head, into the chalky jaws of which it inserts a cigarette. The chalk head smokes, and finally eats, the cigarette. The head of a woman is drawn, which gradually fills and becomes undoubtedly human. Eyes of feminine longing are turned in the direction of a chalk-outlined teapot, which materializes into the real thing, from the spout of which the woman-head drinks with satisfaction. The woman's head resumes its chalky outline, and disappears, feature by feature. The hand of the artist cuts out of paper the figure of a Pierrot. This is placed inside a magic ring drawn on the blackboard. The paper clown changes into a real, embodied Pierrot, who dances, juggles with hoops, and finally dissolves by a rapid catherine-wheel movement into a vivacious head. Head, life size, of the Pierrot. Smoke is seen to issue from the mouth, and comical facial expressions are produced. Again the wheel movement, and the clown disappears. The head of a man is now drawn in chalk. This gradually assumes life and gesticulates in a marvelous manner. The head is seen to split from crown to chin, the halves fall apart, as if hinged, and from the eyes are drawn numberless yards of fine tape. From inside the two halves of the head are produced champagne and liquor in bottles, cigars, cigarettes and glasses. The halves of the head are rejoined, life and comic gesticulations again occur, and the hand of the artist wipes the whole from the blackboard, section by section, though muscular action remains even in the last portion left, one eye which winks at the audience in an impudent manner before being finally wiped out.",None,United Kingdom,N/A,6.2,17,tt0139943,N/A

Drei Tage Angst,1952,N/A,89 min,"Comedy, Crime",Erich Waschneck,Wolf Neumeister,"Rudolf Platte, Ethel Reschke, Beppo Brem","Who ever has heard about Erich Waschneck. He made 43 films and I only saw one: DREI TAGE ANGST. An unknown gangster film ? Yes. But very funny stuff, made by someone who knew his job well. It was made in 1952 by a former saxon lighting cameraman of the silents born in 1887 and was his before last film. The late Rudolf Platte stars brilliantly in it, who is well known to the earlier generation of German film loving people and was always a little in the shadow of Heinz Rühmann.( Later he played The Hauptmann von Köpenick for TV.) Here Platte plays two characters, a humble master tailor from Hamburg, who gets involved in a jewellery theft in Cologne, because he looks very much like a small time crook, who belongs to the Beppo Brehm bunch, that is also after the bundle of jewels  and who are trying to double cross each other. Black and white of cause and with a touch of pre war french comedy. Just great watching Platte hiding in women clothes and making his/her way into a lodgings to get hold of the jewellery hidden inside a huge heating oven. As you may imagine the poor tailor is constantly taken either for the crook either by the police or tall Beppo Brehm or the other way round and everything is so perfectly timed and mixed up you almost start thinking Cary Grant is walking around on high heels. And mind you: Little Cornelia Froboes is doing one of her early appearances in the pictures. The film is mainly studio works full of quick early 50s details and nice sound, but there is a traveling shot in the streets with post war ruins in the background. The director had made it through the Nazi years, but I wonder what his 1940 film is like that carries the title DIE ROTHSCHILDS.

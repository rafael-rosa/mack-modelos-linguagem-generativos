These are social and cultural commentators who at their best can change the way we think about important matters whilst making us howl with laughter. A stand-up comedian must be the writer, the director and the star performer, and unlike any other performance there is no rehearsal, no practice, no safety net, the stand-up can only work in front of a live audience - with feedback being instantaneous and often brutal. For most people baring their soul to then have an audience boo or heckle them would be a life-changing trauma, for stand-ups it's a weekly challenge.

Since then more people have conquered Everest than successfully swum across the Channel. To this day, it remains the ultimate open water swimming challenge. This documentary tells the story of those who keep Captain Webb's vision alive - the volunteer coaches and the unlikeliest of athletes who they tirelessly support in their dream to swim from England to France. The rules are simple - no physical aids, no wimp/wet suits, just a swimsuit, goggles, the all-important swimming cap and a spot of grease to stop the chafing. At the heart of the community are pensioners Freda, Irene and Barry. They can be found in Dover every weekend from May to September come rain or shine, ready to train, feed and grease the wannabe Channel swimmers. The swimmers do not take on this arduous journey alone, and also rely on the skill of the pilots who navigate them safely to the other side of the busiest shipping lane in the world. The community share their highs and lows both in and out of the water as they train together on this small stretch of pebbled beach shadowed by the ferry port. Feasting on jelly babies, and fuelled by adrenalin and dreams, the modern-day swimmer continues to risk it all in this, the ultimate challenge of man versus nature.",English,United Kingdom,N/A,8.0,10,tt5068722,N/A

In temperatures that reach 40 below - where skin freezes, snowmobiles break down, daylight fades fast, thin ice looms and predators are a constant threat - one wrong move can cost you everything. Centuries ago, trapping and fur trading played a vital role in the expansion of North America's western frontier and today, these fearless men and women are trying to uphold that legacy, living on the land - and off the grid. At peace in the great outdoors, they trap during the legally sanctioned season which, in Alaska and Yukon, runs just four to five months in the dead of winter. Deep in the bush, the pressure is on to get iron in the ground, catch fur and navigate the inhospitable terrain on the trap line -- from deadly half-frozen rivers to brutal wind storms, from overcoming injury to avoiding a wolf pack. Miles from the nearest town, help is never close by. But these die-hards are undeterred. They've spent their lifetime mastering the skills needed to survive and carve out a living in one of the most hostile places on earth. And they will protect their way of life at any cost. These are the Klondike Trappers.",English,Canada,1 nomination,5.4,59,tt5070482,N/A

More specifically, his obsession with motorbikes and the invention of the racing bike which was the by-product of his relationship with Stunt Double Bud Ekins and the film they were in together, 'The Great Escape'. As the two men shared their enthusiasm for motorbikes, it was a natural progression for them to work together in Bud's motorbike shop in California, fixing , tinkering and riding, and working to improve performance. This brought about their concept of combining a Metisse frame and a Triumph engine for a new track racing bike. McQueen decided to take this model to England where he met up with the Rickman brothers of Metisse motorbikes, and the 'Desert Racer' was soon born. Decades on, Chad McQueen, Steve's son, authorised the model for reproduction of the 'Desert Racer', and 300 of these Limited Edition motorbikes have been handcrafted by a small company out of Oxfordshire. Narrated by Charlie Boorman, this documentary is packed with precious archive photos and footage, and includes interviews with Chad McQueen, the creator of the replica, and others germane to the story of this side of Steve McQueen's hidden passion.",English,United Kingdom,N/A,7.4,27,tt5072388,N/A

The Secret Tapes of the O.J. Case: The Untold Story,2015,TV-14,84 min,"Documentary, Crime",Charles Braverman,N/A,"O.J. Simpson, Robert Kardashian, Kris Jenner","In 1994, O.J. Simpson - beloved athlete, movie star, spokesperson, and American hero - was charged for the brutal double murder of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman. Although ultimately acquitted on Oct 3, 1994, Simpson was the most famous American ever charged with murder and many - despite the ""mountain of evidence"" - had trouble believing that it could be true. But there was a dark side to O.J. Simpson that most people didn't know. Now for the first time, new interviews with many of O.J. and Nicole's closest friends - including Kris Jenner, Keith Zlomsowitch (Nicole's ex-boyfriend), Robin Greer (a close friend of Nicole's), Joe Kolkowitz (talent agent and member of O.J.'s inner circle), and Fred Levinson (longtime friend of O.J.'s who witnessed his womanizing and controlling behavior) - reveal Simpson's Jekyll and Hyde persona. Through these intimate revelations the portrait of a domineering narcissist emerges, one prone to lies, self-deception, psychological abuse, and domestic violence. The Secret Tapes of the O.J. Case: The Untold Story uses an unprecedented collection of exclusive audio and visual materials, most of which have never been broadcast. Highlights include a suicidal-sounding audio recording made by Simpson shortly before the infamous Bronco chase; deposition testimony of O.J. Simpson being caught in a web of lies while under oath; excerpts from Nicole Simpson's diaries and never before heard audio recordings of O.J.'s now deceased close friend Robert Kardashian (Kris Jenner's ex-husband) who stood by him throughout the ""Trial of the Century"" as his attorney and confidante only to be left with nagging doubt.

O.J. Speaks: The Hidden Tapes,2015,TV-14,86 min,"Documentary, Crime",N/A,Tom Jennings,"O.J. Simpson, Daniel Petrocelli, Fred Goldman","Through exclusive access to O.J. extensive deposition testimony, and exclusive interviews with the key insiders, O.J. SPEAKS tells the story of what it took to finally bring O.J. down. When O.J. Simpson was found not guilty of murder in a Los Angeles criminal court in October 1995 - at the end of the notorious ""Trial of the Century"" - families of the victims thought all hope of getting justice was lost. For Fred Goldman, father of murder victim Ron Goldman, the verdict was especially tough. But from their grief, Fred and his daughter Kim, found another avenue to pursue Simpson. They would join the family of Nicole Brown Simpson in filing a civil lawsuit for the wrongful deaths of Ron and Nicole. Even though a verdict in the Goldman's favor would not put Simpson behind bars, it would be what the family wanted more than anything else - for a court of law to hold the former NFL star responsible for the slayings. Fred and Kim knew they were in over their heads in the legal morass of a civil suit, so they began their search for the right attorney to help them pursue justice. By luck, they stumbled across Dan Petrocelli, a terrific civil lawyer, but one who had never tried anything close to a wrongful death case. The Goldmans believed in Petrocelli's passion and decided he was the right person to go after Simpson. Petrocelli told Fred and Kim that there was one major difference between a criminal case and a civil case. In a criminal case, Simpson did not have to testify. In a civil lawsuit the rules were different. Simpson would, for the first time, have to answer questions under oath about his possible involvement in the double homicide. Under the harsh and unrelenting questioning of Daniel Petrocelli, Simpson's own words revealed an O.J. Simpson who had woven a web of lies and who clearly believed that he was above the law. Told through Simpson's own words in his deposition tapes, this is the story of how the Goldman family and their unlikely choice for an attorney took on one of the nation's biggest celebrities, forced him to talk about his possible involvement in the killings, and dragged him into a different kind of trial - one which Fred Goldman described as being about the law and not about theatrics. It was a trial in which celebrity had no currency - a trial in which O.J.'s own words ultimately proved his responsibility for the double murder finally bringing justice to Fred Goldman and the Brown family.",English,United States,N/A,6.7,91,tt5079674,N/A

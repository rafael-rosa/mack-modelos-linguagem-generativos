The Search,1980,N/A,85 min,Documentary,Amir Naderi,Amir Naderi,N/A,"It all began with ""Black Friday"" - a massacre on Sept 8, 1978, by the Shah's police. Official pronouncements put the death toll at 200, but the next day the people of Teheran witnessed how thousands of bodies were brought to Behast Zahra cemetery. Yet even this wasn't the whole extent of the tragedy. As the families continued looking for their relatives they began to realize just how many had disappeared. Over the next few months the massacres continued, with many thousands more disappearing, until February 11th, 1979, victory day for the Revolution. Naderi's film follows this search for the missing, through which the terrible truth is gradually revealed. The film is not only a documentary but also a document of a horrible crime.",Persian,Iran,1 nomination,7.3,44,tt0336671,N/A

Miss Ophelia goes up to her room in tears and tells her faithful maid, Belinda, that her heart is broken. Belinda goes down and forcibly tells Billy what she thinks of him. Miss Ophelia resolves on suicide, because no one seems to love her. Belinda gets back in time to prevent this and, to divert her mistress, she suggests that they go together to a beauty specialist. Arriving there, both receive attention. Miss Ophelia gets a new complexion, while Belinda gets new teeth. Both invest in new gowns and dresses and the transformation is complete. At supper time, the boarders are all astounded. Miss Ophelia is really nice-looking and arouses the jealousy of all the ladies, so much attention does she receive from the gentlemen. Receiving no return to their advances to Miss Ophelia, they try to flirt with Belinda, who now appears like a trim French maid. She turns them all down very coldly, very much to their surprise. Billy's heart unaccountably changes and he seeks out Miss Ophelia to propose to her. His offer is indignantly refused and he is still more astonished, when, a few minutes later, he and all the other boarders receive notice to quit the house. A sign ""For Sale,"" is placed outside the door and Miss Ophelia and her maid, Belinda, drive off in an automobile before everyone, none of whom can account for the sudden transformation of their erstwhile boarding mistress's appearance and habits.

"Life Story of John Lee, or The Man They Could Not Hang",1921,N/A,88 min,Drama,Arthur W. Sterry,Arthur W. Sterry,"Rose Rooney, David Edelsten","John ""Barracombe"" Lee was convicted on thin evidence of killing his employer, Emma Keyse, and sentenced to hang on 23 February 1885. When the trap failed to open three times, the attending medical officer balked at a fourth try. Lee's sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. He was released in 1907, made a living by lecturing on the miracle, then dropped from sight around 1916. The date and circumstances of his death are uncertain. there are claims he died in a workhouse during World War Two. Another possibility is that he died in the United States in 1945. If you go to Milwaukee, there's a gravestone with that unusual name on it. There is a Fairport Convention song about him, ""Barracombe"", and this Australian film.As a story, it's as thin as the evidence of Lee's conviction. The camerawork and editing are good, and the titles are set in the first person singular. The actor who plays Lee looks to be about Lee's age and the story the titles tell falls short. in an early sequence, Lee desires to join the Royal Navy, contrary to his father's wishes. When asked why, his father explains his own father was a fisherman who ""put to sea, as was the custom"" and drowned one stormy night; this only serves to strengthen Lee's desire to join the Navy. Later, Lee develops a strong belief that his salvation was a miracle. This undoubtedly played well on the lecture circuit.The movie has some interest as a survivor of Australia's silent era. Unhappily, it does not argue for a high standard of the national cinema.",None,Australia,N/A,6.0,19,tt0336751,N/A

Race,1996,N/A,N/A,Drama,Ryan Haidarian,N/A,"Sam Hennings, Larry John Meyers, Alexandra Powers, Gloria McCord","'Race' is a story of incorruptible intent, exposing the color of the human heart. Sitting on a time bomb of anxiety, Mance Hopkins is a small town prison inmate. Other than his color, we know nothing of his crime. But a story of pain and love bleeds from Hopkin's eyes as he paces in his cage, searching for a way out of anguish. What bothers him is not his cell. There's something out there - a time bomb waiting to go off. Breaking out of his shackles with a sudden surge of determination, he risks life and dignity in search of that thing which is greater than him. The object of his quest lies a night and a day away, beyond a bridge, a river and a set of train tracks. The hazards of nature and four viciously trained dogs set out to hunt down the escapee and trigger a race of no return. The path less trodden leads the protagonists, inmate, tracker and all, to a climactic summit of confrontation with the self. Dynamically paced to reflect the inner journey of a mesmerized audience, this film is a rendezvous with one man's demons and another man's God. Set in small town Texas, the film unfolds associations that are painfully true to some of the most fundamental issues underlying a much afflicted world community - thus staying loyal to the universal pun against time: 'race'.",English,USA,N/A,1.8,529,tt0337075,N/A

The Silver Swan,1952–,N/A,30 min,N/A,Rex Tucker,C.E. Webber,"Carole Maybank, Shaun Sutton, Robert Irvine","I was only eight years old when I saw the children's BBC TV serial ""The Silver Swan"" and I am now 66. I still remember how it fascinated me, with its element of time travel. I remember it as a very romantic drama, with the action centred around an old violin, and the ability to step back in time through a mirror. The serial haunted me for years, especially the signature tune, which according to the BBC was an arrangement for violin and piano of Orlando Gibbons's madrigal ""The Silver Swan"". Although I later sang in this madrigal at school, the TV serial arrangement was rather different - strange to say I can still hear the last six bars of it in my head, so much did I love it. I would love a chance to see the serial again, but I was told by the BBC years ago that they thought it may have been wiped.Nearly 60 years later I still love fantasy adventure - my desert island book is 'The Lord of the Rings', and I lapped up the 'Harry Potter' books. But it was 'The Silver Swan' that started it all. Looking at the details now, I see that the piece was given excellent in-depth casting and a very experienced producer and writer - so I must have been able to appreciate a good thing even at the age of eight!",English,United Kingdom,N/A,7.2,5,tt0337200,N/A

Magnus Opus,2003,N/A,99 min,"Comedy, Drama","Gordon Currie, Andrew Kenneth Martin","Gordon Currie, Andrew Kenneth Martin","Thanos Tripi, Kamran Hisari, Andrika Lawren","In the fall of 2002, three independent film makers, Gordon Currie, Andrew Kenneth Martin and Andrika Lawren, embarked on a labyrinthine journey into the depths of independent film making.  While all three have worked in the bellows of the independent film market before, perhaps only Gordon Currie will be even remotely recognized by any niche of film makers and film fans in this country or any other.  Currie has more than 40 film and television appearances to his credit and to us die hard horror afficionodoes, he was in Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhatten.  The point being, these three are long in ambition and talent but short on a plethora of experience. And yet here they were, taking on the monumental task of financing, producing, directing, casting, editing and acting in a film that enveloped two years of their lives.  With the guargantuan budget of $5000.00, this was going to be the epitome of guerilla film making on the streets of Toronto.What we have with the finished product is nothing short of brilliance!  I don't know where they came up with the idea and frankly I don't want to know nor am I inclined to care, it might ruin the experience you see on screen. And that is what this film is, an experience.  You will leave the theater marvelling at the film.  Magnus Opus is, if nothing else, a labour of love forged by three remarkable talents who came together and altruistically created a film that could be destined for a distribution deal as it has already been submitted for consideration in such film festivals as Sundance and a few others.  Magnus Opus is a triumph of independent film making and the three of them and everyone involved should be proud.  I do not know the names of all the principals here as they have not been released to the public yet, so you will have to bear with me when it comes to singing the praises of certain actors.Magnus Opus is a mockumentary filmed in the vein of This is Spinal Tap. The story centers around a self centered, sanctimonious, struggling artist named Magnus.  Like all struggling artists, he feels that there is more to life than what we are led to believe.  He sees a certain pulchritude and a certain ugliness to life that many of us see yet are powerless to do anything about.  Some of his fellow artists that were once great in his eyes have sold out to corporate sponsorship and now are a walking billboard for the company they endorse.  This sell out now has a tattoo of the cereal brand emblazened on his muscular chest.  Meanwhile, Magnus has just received a grant from some arsty fartsy school and he means to use that grant money to create something called live art.  This is when he hires a documentary crew, played brilliantly by producer Andrika Lawren and Marcus.  I don't know Marcus' last name but just suffice to say that Marcus, in my humble opinion, was the best part of the film as he nails his character down better than anyone else.  His job is to take crap from Magnus all during the film but get paid $100.00 a day to do it.  Yet, every time he asks Magnus a question, Magnus deducts $20.00 from his pay.  His privacy is very important to him.Since Magnus has hired Marcus, the techie for 33 days, it is a handsome sum of money.  Marcus looks lost most of the time and it is this character that we can all live vicariously through as he correctly conveys what most of us, the audience, are feeling.  What the hell is Magnus up to?  What is his purpose and why is he so mysterious and why such drama?  Marcus is priceless in his role as techie and he steals scenes from the great Toronto actor who plays Magnus.  His name escapes me as well, but he does a fine job with his character.Magnus' ultimate goal is to create the live art so that he may grow famous in a Toronto storefront window.  But little or no audience comes to see his macabre show and little by little his spirits dampen.  But what he is really up to is a beautiful twist that is on par with The Usual Suspects or Sixth Sense.  M. Night Shyamalan...eat your heart out!!All of this sounds very linear so far but the best part of the film is what Martin and Currie constructed by having the documentary crew find and film many of the people in Magnus' life, present and past.  This is the true tour de force of the film as there is not one disingenuous performance out of any of the characters who decorate the screen.  While every one of them are amateur actors, many of them struggling Toronto players, each of them honestly gives the film a colourful palette of energy that is infectious from the opening frame.  We meet an eclectic array of personalities from his Terri Garr look alike mother who always gave him money, sometimes to shut him up, sometimes to encourage him.  She is humourous and honest when she tells us about his habits as a child.  There is his drug dealer, his myopic lawyer, his jilted ex lover who wants to have an imprint of Magnus' face sewn onto her motorcycle seat so she can always be sitting on his face. We also get to meet his frail priest, a Mary Steenbergen look a like as his quiet and sweet elementary school teacher.  And then we get to meet some of his older friends.  In two of the funniest performances in the film, we get to meet one friend who used to work with him in a drugstore and his best friend from youth who is the complete antithesis of Magnus.  Where as Magnus believes art is from within, his best friend Jimmy, thinks there is nothing better than a Saturday afternoon watching wrestling, having a barbeque and playing with his dog.  This was probably the funniest character and Gordon and Andrew can take the credit for writing and improvising such brilliant scenes for the actors to embellish.  While every actor adds a lot of their own interpretation to the character at hand, it is with Currie and Martin's guidance that we see what we do on screen.Magnus Opus is a treat to behold.  It is expressive and it is interesting. It is also one of the funniest films I have seen in quite a while and what makes it so humourous is the honesty that resonates from its words and actions.  Also, if you thought Robert Rodriguez's El Mariachi was a triumph of independent film making, Magnus Opus will give it a run for its money. El Mariachi was a fantastic film made for $7000.00 and this was made for $5000.00.  I truly hope a distributor is bold enough to give this a chance. While it is a bit esoteric in its humour, there is enough in here for everyone to love and there is nothing that I would like better than to see it grace the shelves of my local Rogers Video and Blockbuster.Congratulations Gordon, Andrew and Andrika.  You are fabulous film makers and I wish you nothing but success.One more thing.  Gordon, I want to meet Kane Hodder one day.  See if you can hook it up.  And if you ever want to make a horror film, call me again. I'd do anything to be in one and if you were at the helm, it'd be my honour to work with all three of you again.

The female of the group, named Kanaalaq, has what Charlie suspects is tuberculosis. In exchange for some ivory, Charlie agrees to fly her to a hospital in Yellowknife. En route back to the city, Charlie is forced to make a crash landing when the plane develops mechanical problems. Although both Charlie and Kanaalaq are unharmed by the crash, the plane is totaled, they are in the middle of nowhere, the radio doesn't seem to be working, they have a meager amount of supplies, and Charlie's whereabouts are probably unknown to others since he made a detour from his original route. Furthermore, they can't communicate with each other as Kanaalaq only knows a few words of English, whereas Charlie knows no Inuktituk. According to his map, Charlie estimates it is one hundred miles to the closest town and decides to walk. He soon learns that he is not well equipped for outdoor life in the north, at least not as well equipped as Kanaalaq, who is in her element. He figures that things can only get worse for both him dealing with the elements and Kanaalaq suffering from her illness as the winter snows approach.","English, Inuktitut",Canada,9 wins & 24 nominations total,7.3,"11,760",tt0337721,N/A

Hotel Erotica,2002–,TV-MA,29 min,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy",N/A,N/A,"Tina Wiseman, Lauren Hays, Beverly Lynne","This review is for the UK DVD three-disc box set. Disc one is called Caught in the Act and contains Model Behavior, Chasing Jamie and Fast and Curious. Disc two is called Bedroom Fantasies and contains Blue Plate Special, Falling in Lust Again and Love Potion No. 10. The final disc is called Anything Goes and contains Chatroom, She's the Boss and Legally Yours. Why the other four episodes in the series are not included is a mystery because there is surely enough room on the discs for a lot more material.Each episode opens with the hotel manager Chloe (Lauren Hayes) reading a letter from a satisfied customer. We then get to see the story unfolding as the guests check into the hotel. Blue Plate Special is the exception because this story is from a waitress. The writers should be given credit for coming up with a good variety of story lines. For instance, Model Behavior is about two models vying for the attention of the photo crew; Falling in Lust Again is about a man and woman who parted and rekindle their love when they meet up again at the hotel; She's the Boss is about a put-upon male secretary/dogsbody who shows that he is more of a man than his female boss realised - much to her pleasure. All the episodes lead up to lots of nudity and sex.It should come as no surprise that all the characters in this hotel are beautiful women and handsome hunks. Even the geeky secretaries get transformed when they remove their spectacles and let their hair down. The sex action is plentiful but to me seems too frantic and false. The camera work could also have done with a bit of moderation, spending too much time close up and so moving about to capture everything, and as usual we get loud music during the sex action. Finally, the end credits mention the Palm Canopy Hotel, Singer Island, Florida although my map of Florida shows no Singer Island. The scenery certainly looks more like Florida than Utah or Las Vegas that some people have mentioned. This is quite a good effort and it is a pity that the second series is still awaiting a UK DVD release. 4 stars.",English,United States,N/A,5.7,304,tt0337764,N/A

She decides to repay her creator by taking care of his son, Suguru, working as a maid at the boy's residence. The two get along wonderfully, but Mahoro constantly finds herself at odds with others in Suguru's life; the most bizarre of which being his lecherous high school teacher.

Nonno Felice,1993–1995,N/A,N/A,Comedy,N/A,N/A,"Gino Bramieri, Paola Onofri, Franco Oppini","""Nonno Felice"" is an Italian play on words that could mean ""Happy Grandpa"" or ""Grandpa Felice"" since ""Felice"" is also an Italian last name. But enough of the Italian lesson, NONNO FELICE is one of the few Italian sitcoms that lack that ""antiseptic, sterile setting"" that seems to plague most of the Italian sitcoms. The film crews borrow a few techniques from the American sitcoms, making this sitcom a surefire hit.Nonno Felice is a lovable senior citizen who is stubbornly set in his ways and who is also a little ""naughty-but-nice"". While he is a source of mirth and merriment to his grandchildren, who simply adore him, he is also a great source of worry and grief to their parents, Paolo and Ginevra, because of his somewhat mischievous ways.For example, on one episode, the parents hired a tutor to help their children with their schoolwork. But the tutor turned out to be a gorgeous long-legged, raven haired beauty who also caught the attention of Nonno Felice's roving eye.In another episode, Nonno Feloice bought a pasty from a nearby bar. (In Italy, a bar that deals with alcohol is called a ""taverno"" or an ""American bar"" while the bar that Nonno Felice visited dealt mainly with pastries.) The problem here was that he walked outside and bumped into the Guardia Finanzia (finance police) with his pastry but no receipt! This caused quite a bit of grief for everyone and poor Franco had to pay the fine.No matter how hard Paolo and his wife Ginevra try to keep their Nonno Felice out of mischief, he is almost always one step ahead of them. So it is no wonder that Nonno Felice is a constant source of worry for Franco and Ginevra. Yet no matter what happens, it is hard to stay mad at Nonno Felice.The combination of the Late Great Gino Bramieri's sharp one-liners and the comedy in this series, makes for great entertainment.",Italian,Italy,N/A,5.9,45,tt0337773,N/A

(most big directors already come from money and don't get to see the grittier side of humanity because they're too busy sweetening up the story so it will have a sugar-coated ending...underground film does NOT cater to these whims and though Amy ""may or may not"" have strangled a small child, that's not really what i got out of it. this kind of thing happens in America daily and films like this are only made to remind you of this. something to heed when you close your blinds and pop in that latest Disney film. living down the block could be a girl just like Amy...parents would be wise to remember this! muahahahaha.........if you can't bring yourself to appreciate southern ""punk"" culture or the films of John Waters, this film is not for you....i gave this film a 3 on Amanda's acting alone.",N/A,United States,N/A,6.6,16,tt0337822,N/A

They spend much of their time at their local Knapely, Yorkshire County chapter of the Women's Institute (WI), whose motto is ""enlightenment, fun, and friendship"". Although they like most of the women at the WI (the friendship part), they, but the perceived flaky Chris in particular, hold the way Marie (Geraldine James), the local President, runs the chapter with derision. They find much of what goes on there, especially the monthly presentations, banal and devoid of enlightenment and fun. Equally as banal was last year's fund-raising calendar, featuring local bridges, which raised a meager £75.60, with this year's proposed calendar, local churches, promising to be even more so. After Annie's husband John (John Alderton) dies from leukemia, Chris wants the WI to provide a memorial in his memory: a new sofa for the family room at the hospital. The one Chris wants to buy costs nine hundred ninety-nine pounds sterling, which she proposes to raise by changing the fund-raising calendar to one featuring tasteful photographs of nude Knapely WI members. She got the idea by seeing all around her the notion of the old adage that sex sells. Annie likes the idea as it is analogous to one of horticultural-loving John's last statements about plants being the most glorious in the latter stages of their life, after which they quickly go to seed. To get the project off the ground, they not only have to convince nine other WI members to pose (December to be a group photograph), but they have to find a photographer they trust that will treat this task as an art project. Conversely, they aren't sure if they and the calendar will meet with the same contempt from Marie, the national WI organization and their friends and family that they are so trying to change in the Knapely WI, and in the process not only not raise the necessary money, but, in fact lose money instead. or the project in any form may have its own consequences, especially for Chris.",English,"United Kingdom, United States",2 wins & 16 nominations,6.9,"28,384",tt0337909,60

It is rare to find a production which attempts so complicated a statement. While this makes OCTAVIA  demanding viewing, particularly for someone who doesn't speak its language, it remains a work of high seriousness which goes a long way towards achieving it's aims.Key is the scene where Sola, returning to the family home after years of following a troubled international career, goes through his Stasi file (given him by cop Paul Naschy of all people) with his new wife and we get a potted history of the character and Spanish politics since the fifties.The conflict is between the perceptions of Dona Lozano the Carlist matriarch who treasures the Salamanca family traditions and young, intermittently naked grand daughter Menh-Wai/ Octavia product of the (possibly forced) union of the nun daughter (terrific performance) and a jungle guerilla who she imagines is still financing his activities from the cocaine she and her friends use. The situation is explored in a whole variety of situations and scenics which keep turning the audiences perceptions of the characters and their setting.The ending, where the stone slab with the single word on it clunks into place, as Terenza Beganza and the orchestra provide the music which we've been hearing through the production, is a remarkably telling combination.Great to see the way Spanish film can still finds space for players as diverse as Naschy and Lozano.",Spanish,"Spain, France",1 win & 1 nomination,6.0,56,tt0338297,N/A

Power and Terror: Noam Chomsky in Our Times,2002,Not Rated,74 min,Documentary,John Junkerman,N/A,"Noam Chomsky, Carol Chomsky","Whether Noam Chomsky, the MIT linguist and political philosopher, is the most important intellectual alive, as the New York Times once famously called him, is open for debate. But without a doubt, Chomsky, now 73, is one of the most straight-talking and committed dissidents of our time. A steadfast critic of United States foreign policy for decades, in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11th, his profile took a quantum leap as he provided much-needed analysis and historical perspective to concerned citizens throughout the world. In the months that followed, he gave dozens of talks on four continents, conducted scores of interviews, and wrote a book 9-11 that was published in 22 countries and became a surprise bestseller in many of them, including Japan. Chomsky's voice may be unpopular, but his incisive arguments, based on decades of research and analysis, are heard and considered in this chronicle comprised of interview footage, and various talks he's given. Chomsky places the terrorist attacks in the context of American foreign intervention throughout the postwar decades--in Vietnam, Central America, the Middle East, and elsewhere. Beginning with the fundamental principle that the exercise of violence against civilian populations is terror, regardless of whether the perpetrator is a well-organized band of Muslim extremists, or the most powerful state in the world. Chomsky, in stark and uncompromising terms, challenges the United States to apply to its own actions the moral standards it demands of others.",English,"United States, Japan",N/A,6.9,617,tt0338357,48

An aspiring artist, she is barely eking out a living working as a clerk at the women's evening gloves counter at Saks Fifth Avenue in Beverly Hills and thus she can barely make the payments on her massive student loans. She treats her job with a certain distance, often daydreaming as she watches the life of the rich as they shop at the store. She has made no friends, including from among her Saks colleagues, and thus lives a solitary existence, which does not assist in her dealing with her chronic clinical depression. So it is with some surprise that two men with a romantic interest in her enter her life almost simultaneously. The first is poor slacker Jeremy, who works as an amplifier salesman/font designer. Mirabelle continues dating Jeremy as only a relief to her solitary life, as Jeremy doesn't seem to understand how to treat her in the way she wants. Shortly after meeting Jeremy, she meets the second, wealthy fifty-something Ray Porter, who is the antithesis of Jeremy in almost every respect, including the fact that Ray is unwilling or unable to commit to Mirabelle, about which he is up front to her. To Mirabelle, that lack of commitment from Ray seems to be in name only, and as such she increasingly sees Ray as her boyfriend. Mirabelle has to decide if a long term future is either in the cards with Jeremy or Ray, which is made all the more complicated by an action by Jeremy to an off the cuff comment that she makes to him.","English, Japanese",United States,1 win & 7 nominations total,6.3,"25,018",tt0338427,62

Two Brothers,2004,PG,109 min,"Adventure, Drama, Family",Jean-Jacques Annaud,"Alain Godard, Jean-Jacques Annaud, Julian Fellowes","Guy Pearce, Freddie Highmore, Jean-Claude Dreyfus","1920s Indochina. In the wild, a pair of adult tigers have just had a litter of two male cubs. It is a loving family unit, with the two brothers having a bond through their adventurous spirit. In different incidents, the cubs are captured individually, and although both in captivity live very different lives. Their individual captures were directly or indirectly associated with the work of Aidan McRory, a treasure and big game hunter, whose main goal is to make as much money for himself by selling his largely illegally obtained artifacts and animal parts at auction in Europe. Through the process, he has an emotional connection with one of the cubs, who is eventually named Kumal, but of who he eventually loses track. The cubs' lives are affected negatively by a number of other people who are working solely toward their own end goals, but the other cub, who is eventually named Sangha, also makes an emotional human connection to a young boy named Raoul Normandin, the son of the area administrator. Similar to Kumal and Aidan, Raoul eventually loses track of his tiger friend. The second year of the cubs' lives, they now full fledged adult tigers, is different than their first, with a question being how their individual experiences in captivity will affect how they function in their much different new environments. Both Aidan and Raoul are determined to do whatever necessary to make sure what happens to the tigers are for the benefit of the lives they should be leading based on their history, with Aidan and Raoul perhaps having a different perspective on what that actually is.","English, Thai, French","France, United Kingdom",2 wins & 2 nominations total,7.0,"16,127",tt0338512,63

In fact, the Chinese custom of celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival on the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month originated from both legends. By building on and making inferences from these two popular legends, this 30-episode period drama with romance and action has been created. Our story starts with an introduction to Liu An, a prince in the Han dynasty, whose interests in myths and legends sparked a desire desire to pen down the beautiful love story of Chang Er and Hou Yi. Legend has it that the Heavenly Jade Emperor has an extra-marital affair which resulted in the birth of Chang Er. In order to appease the Heavenly Empress Xi He, he gives her all authority over the love affairs in heaven. Hou Yi is a Heavenly Archer who is upright and righteous albeit rather tactless. As a result of his lack of EQ, he is banished to the Earth to help the common folk. There, he gets adopted into an earthly family and learns to appreciate human relationships and love. Meanwhile in the moon, the moon fairy Chang Er is getting bored. When Dragon escaped from heaven to create havoc on Earth, she eagerly volunteered to help recapture Dragon. However, this enthusiasm is dampened by Hou Yi's blunt remarks about her being naïve and ignorant of the beauty of love found on Earth as well as the plight that Dragon has put humans in. Determined to prove Hou Yi wrong, she leaves her moon palace and descends to the Earth secretly. In working together with Hou Yi to help the villages fight against Dragon, Chang Er and Hou Yi develop mutual affections for each other. However, Hou Yi's earthly brother Feng Yi also falls for Chang Er. Chang Er's friend Luo Pin, who is the daughter of Immortal Fu Xi, is also mesmerized by Hou Yi. To make the four-sided relationship even more complicated, Xi He finds out about Chang Er and Hou Yi's relationship and is bent on separating them. Coupled with her Sun Crown Prince's deep hatred for Hou Yi, they begin their horrid plans to make the two lovers suffer. The plans culminated into a plot to destroy Earth and to re-create a new one. The ten Sun Princes appear in the sky together to bring the earth to an unbearable scorching temperature. In order to save humankind, Hou Yi and Chang Er must obtain the Fiery Bow and Ice Arrow from the hottest and coldest parts of Heaven and Earth simultaneously. But to do so, they have to take the elixir of two extremes respectively to protect themselves from the elements.

It was featured with enormous success in the satyrical spanish magazine ""El Jueves"" right until the author's death in 1993 (by a car accident) and generated a cult following that still exists.The humor of the series, its critical approach to national issues (Franco, politics, ETA, etc.) and above all, its main character's (Makinavaja or Maki) philosophy were the keys of its success. Because of this success Makinavaja was versioned in theatre, film and TV with different results.The TV-series was the only one that really captured the character spirit, with an outstanding Pepe Rubianes as Makinavaja, plots faithfully based in the original stories by Ivá and most important, a change of direction during the 2nd season (thanks to José Luis Cuerda) changing the usually bad-taste and scatological humor from the movies by a more satyrical approach...The supporting cast was excellent too: Mario Pardo, for example, reprising his role from the films proved that he was a perfect Moromierda (just read the comics, this was one of the best characters).Summarizing, a very well made series especially recommended for fans of the comic and Ivá...",Spanish,Spain,N/A,5.8,154,tt0338623,N/A

The format is four actors and the same set of stock sketches varied in each episode - a recipe for disaster in some past attempts, when more faith was placed in the actors' ability to ad-lib than the actual script.Here both the cast and the script are up to the task, and the production is polished enough. The unifying theme of all the sketches is couples and relationships, a somewhat conservative subject handled with wit but without attempt at controversy (even if one couple comprises two gay pastors). A kind of self-mocking female angle in the style of Smack the Pony is also present, of women laughing at both themselves and male perceptions of women.The sketches themselves include gender stereotype reversals (foul-mouthed old ladies with only thing in their minds; gruff construction workers complaining about losing their figure or lack of romance in their lives), genre parodies (American-style shopping television - an easy target for ridicule if there ever was one), and even a bit of slapstick. Obviously, it has its hits and misses: the best one features Heiskanen as an insanely jealous pensioner who is convinced that his mousy wife is having it off with just about everyone and everything. On the other hand, the one bit about a Kama Sutra couple who find it anatomically impossible to translate the instructions into action, is funny the first time but just becomes excruciating upon repeat. The balance is on the positive side, though, because most sketches can wrench enough surreal excitement out of familiar ideas and the cast is capable enough to play the necessary range of types with suitable relish.In the final analysis, it was a pleasant diversion but didn't change the world.

The two stories are completely unrelated, and homage to the original Raideen's design is paid only in the design of God Reideen in this series. Ten members of the ancient warrior race of Reideen awakens in the body of ten teenagers to battle the super demons. The super demons who lost the battle to the Reideens in the ancient past is bent on winning this time by awakening the God Reideen to use against the Reideens. Each of the ten Reideen character takes a form from a bird which gives them their unique style. Each can transform themselves into god bird in the heat of the battle as Brave Raideen did. Every episode features different super demon and story builds to the awakening of God Reideen. Twist to the story is that God Reideen is an engine of destruction, and goes to destroy the world.Chouja Reideen was originally scheduled to finish after 26 episodes but due to its popularity, was extended to 38 episodes. Maybe for this reason, the first 27 episodes and the last 11 episodes have different feel to the story. First half deals with super demon's attempt to collect 12 orbs of the zodiac to awaken God Reideen. Second half deals with strange battle that ensues between the Reideens.Characters were designed to capture female audiences (there are many women anime fans in Japan), and heroes turning naked during transformation and after was put in to appeal to this target audience.The quality of artwork gets better as the series progresses, and the last 10 episodes are truly stunning.

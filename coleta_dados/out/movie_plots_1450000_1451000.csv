He is looking for former inmates of the Moskobiya interrogation centre in Jerusalem. In his ad he asks that the men should also have experience as craftsmen, architects or actors. After a casting process that almost feels like role play, he arranges for a replica of the centre's interrogation rooms and cells to be built to scale inside a hall - under close supervision from the former inmates and based on their memories. In this realistic setting the men subsequently re-enact their interrogations, discuss details about the prison, and express the humiliation they experienced during their detention. Using techniques that are reminiscent of the so-called 'theatre of the oppressed' they work together to dramatise their real-life experiences. Their reconstruction brings long repressed emotions and undealt with trauma to the fore. Working on the film takes its toll on the men - both physically and mentally. The director also appears in front of the camera; not only is he creating a stage for his protagonists, he is also coming to terms with his own fragmented memories of imprisonment in Moskobiya thirty years previously.",Arabic,"Occupied Palestinian Territory, France, Switzerland, Qatar, Italy",1 win & 6 nominations,7.1,255,tt6568868,N/A

The Fruit Machine,2018,N/A,81 min,Documentary,Sarah Fodey,Sarah Fodey,"Johanne Boutin, Andrew Currie-Beckstead, Julie Trudel","Through interviews with academics, historians, journalists and victims, some of the stories behind the Canadian government's purge of homosexuals from the civil service from the late 1940s to the end of the century are presented, the effect not only being a purge, but also a persecution in the victims asked to provide ""names"" in the process. That purge was despite many of those victims having exemplary service records otherwise, and the authorities largely not having any proof that who they were letting go was indeed a homosexual. The misguided rationale for the purge - what many of those historians view as a convenient excuse of the times - is told, where homosexuality was largely not an issue in the hiring or firing within the civil service before that. Two sub-issues are discussed in further detail. The first is the development of a program centered on what was coined ""the fruit machine"", a machine that could purportedly determine if one was indeed a homosexual, in the government's want for ""scientific proof"". The second is the ramping up of that purge in the Canadian military, especially within the female ranks, starting in the early 1970s following the decriminalization of homosexuality. As an epilogue, many of the victim interviewees discuss what they would like to see happen in light of their victimization, and what they would do now if they had the option of that career again. In addition, what happened to those victim interviewees both professionally and personally following their ""firing"" is shown.","English, French",Canada,4 wins & 2 nominations,7.9,72,tt6569888,N/A

That is not the son she wants to remember. She wants to remember GG, the man - a loving son and brother. Brother Merle, on the other hand, keeps himself and the myth about the world's most destructive rock'n roll musician going by selling merchandise and by breathing life into their old joint band, Murder Junkies.

Mack the Knife - Brecht's Threepenny Film,2018,N/A,130 min,"Biography, Drama",Joachim Lang,"Joachim Lang, Bertolt Brecht, Kurt Weill","Lars Eidinger, Tobias Moretti, Hannah Herzsprung","Against many odds, Bertolt Brecht's ""The Threepenny Opera"" becomes a phenomenal success. The film industry picks up the scent and seeks to make the master direct a film version of his ""play with music"". Brecht though refuses to play by their rules. While the studio wants to censor the ""filth"" and tuck at the heart strings to cash in on the success, the author wants to make nothing less than a completely new kind of film. A socialist critique on capitalism, staged as a conflict between Mack the Knife, a London gangster, and Peachum, the head of the beggars' mafia. And Brecht does not bow down; he takes the producers to court in order to prove that the moneyed interests are prevailing over his right as an author - and the right of the audience. Provocative, outrageously colorful and merging fact with the fictional and the visionary, Brecht's ""true"" Threepennyfilm comes to life before the author's eyes. A film that was never made. An artist who challenges the industry and audience alike. A poet directing reality. That has never happened before.",German,"Germany, Belgium",2 wins & 3 nominations,6.5,720,tt6575280,N/A

Born in Denver in 1909, Fante grew up in a working class Italian-American family that was plagued by prejudice and poverty. At 21, he struck out for Los Angeles and wrote the autobiographical novels The Road to Los Angeles, Dreams from Bunker Hill and his most acclaimed work, Ask the Dust, capturing the rhythms of Los Angeles life in prose that later inspired such writers as Charles Bukowski, who famously referred to Fante as ""my God."" Like Bukowski, Fante shouldered bitter resentments, spending his non-writing hours drinking, gambling and toiling miserably as a Hollywood screenwriter. ""A sad flower of the sand"" explores Fante's art and life through interviews with those who knew him best: writer/director Robert Towne ""Chinatown"", publisher John Martin, his biographer Stephen Cooper, wife Joyce and sons, Jim and Dan. The result is a hypnotic tour through Fante's life, work and his beloved Los Angeles--with old and new footage of the streets, hotels and gin joints that were his home and inspiration.",English,United States,N/A,7.7,10,tt6581336,N/A

"Easy to Learn, Hard to Master: The Fate of Atari",2017,N/A,110 min,Documentary,Tomaso Walliser,Tomaso Walliser,"Bil Herd, Nolan Bushnell, Manny Gerard","Before Google, Yahoo and even Apple, before the Silicon Valley cliché of informal dress code, skateboards running the corridors and wild creativity became commonplace, one company embodied the digital economy lifestyle and business style: the one firm coming out of the Age of Aquarius was Atari. The story of Atari is two-thirds the story of Nolan Bushnell, founder and visionary, and one-third the first and probably biggest boom and bust of the new economy some 20 years before the new economy even existed. Atari was showing that technology is cool, way before the personal computer revolution took place and they were reaching out to an ever-growing audience with something that is still cool today: video games. Atari literally introduced the digital world to the mass consciousness. Nolan Bushnell and Atari have a huge collection of firsts: the first successful video game company, the first coin-op video game ever, the first general purpose console to win the market, the first marriage between video games and movie industry in the history of entertainment, the fastest growing company in history, the biggest industry crash ever, the weirdest anecdotes in Silicon Valley, the coolest brand on the planet... Atari is a story to be told for two main reasons: it is pure fun and it is impressively educational. Going through the ups and downs of Atari's ride, one can learn when and how our relationship with the digital world was born (ahead of Apple, Commodore, Microsoft and even the Homebrew Computer Club), how the 100 billion dollars a year video game industry was born, what to do to make your idea successful, what to do to screw it all up, whether to sell your baby to a giant major or not, what not to do to preserve your market from crashing and many others interesting topics.",English,Italy,N/A,6.5,295,tt6585674,N/A

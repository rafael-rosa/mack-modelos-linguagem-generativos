Perdida,1950,N/A,91 min,Drama,Fernando A. Rivero,"José Revueltas, Fernando A. Rivero, Carlos Sampelayo","Ninón Sevilla, Agustín Lara, Domingo Soler","The story of Perdida is interesting enough. In more skilled hands it could have become a classic Mexican melodrama, but the film sometimes plods along and the story loses some of its effectiveness. In films like ""Victimas del Pecado"" and ""Aventurera"" (both featuring Niñon Sevilla), the musical numbers mix effortlessly with the plot. Fernando Rivero, the director, is sometimes heavy-handed - some scenes drag a bit too much, but all in all, it is still fun to see the film - Niñon Sevilla and the musical numbers take charge of that.The story is traditional enough. It talks about a naive country girl who is raped by her stepfather, runs away and goes to the big city, looking for a job. Needless to say, she ends up in a brothel and all kinds of misfortunes befall the poor girl. I think that I'm not spoiling anything because this is a traditional story line that many Mexican films followed at the time.There is one scene in particular that I like a lot: Niñon Sevilla is sitting sadly on an armchair in the brothel where she had been trapped, and the trio ""Los Panchos"" descends slowly the staircase with their guitars singing ""Perdida"" (perdida could be translated in English as ""fallen woman"". They stop in front of her, always singing, and whenever they sing the refrain Perdida (Fallen Woman) the camera shows Niñon Sevilla's face bathed in tears. It's unbelievable! But you have to think that scenes like that made many people cry in the movie theater at the time. In one of her musical performances, Niñon Sevilla (dressed as Carmen Miranda), with the Anjos do Inferno as backing group, sings ""Nego"" in Portuguese - her Spanish accent is very sexy!Unfortunately Fernando Rivero hasn't got the handicraft ability of Alberto Gout, or the melodramatic poetry of Emilio Fernandez.

The game consisted of two rounds, each with two parts. In the first part of each round, host Tomarken read a toss-up question; the first to signal is given a chance to answer. That response, plus two other possible answers are then listed, with the other two contestant then given a chance to choose from the three listed answers. A correct answer earned the first contestant three spins and his/her opponents one spin each. Four such questions were played; the players used the spins to accumulate cash and prizes on an 18-space board. One contestant at a time is in control of the board; he/she stopped a randomly-flashing cursor by pressing his signal device (and usually the scream ""STOP!""). The contestant wins whatever appears in the lit space a cash amount, a prize, perhaps an extra spin or other action space ... or it could be a Whammy, which caused the contestant to lose all he/she had accumulated in that game. The Whammy was an animated devil who starred in the sequences, which played when a contestant lost his winnings. As long as a contestant is in control of the board, he/she can continue to press their luck and possibly lose their accumulated winnings on the next spin or elect to pass his/her remaining spins to an opponent (the leader or the player in second place, depending on who passes), meaning he/she must use those spins. Any player who lands on four whammies is eliminated from the game; the high scorer after two rounds is the winner and returns. Only the winner keeps what he/she had won; a player continued until winning five shows, until defeated or winning $25,000 (later $50,000, then the winnings limit at CBS). The most famous contestant on ""Press Your Luck"" was Michael Larson, who memorized the flashing patterns of the gameboard cursor. Putting his knowledge to use, he racked $110,000 in cash and prizes during his 1984 appearance on the show (which was broken into a two-part show); the game was soon redesigned by the producers to prevent future fortune-hunting gameplay.

Fantastic Orgy,1977,X,72 min,Adult,Carlos Tobalina,N/A,"Iris Medina, Lesllie Bovee, Clair Dia","My nominee for Carlos Tobalina's worst film (a highly competitive race to be sure) is MAI LIN VS. SERENA, which I suffered through inside a Times Square adult theater back in the '80s and felt was the worst movie I'd seen up until that time. But for sheer laziness and sloppiness, FANTASTIC ORGY has to qualify for consideration in CT's race to the bottom.It is essentially an hour-plus of recycled footage, not highlights but random junk from CT's vaults. It is structured (if I can abuse that word) as a tribute to Carlos's affirmative action recipient Iris Medina, an unattractive and untalented performer we see as extra (sitting around at orgies) or active XXX participant (get the hook!).There is a modicum of new footage, as hostess ""Martha Sharp"" introduces us to Iris, and manages to call her Irene a few seconds later -no retakes, flub left in finished 35mm film. Medina speaks haltingly a few words in heavily accented English, then takes over as voice- over narrator spoken by someone else without a trace of accent, but forced to recite endless gibberish undoubtedly penned by Tobalina. The narrator's comments about ""herself"" ring about as true as what the old men's magazines of the '50s and '60s used to call ""semi-fiction"": the blurbs about models (their bio, likes &amp; dislikes) appearing in photo spreads, or perhaps the soap opera arcs of Vince McMahon's WWF became WWE rassling organization.But the fake loquacious voice-over Iris likes to praise others, naturally her producer Tobalina (the only guy who ever hired her for a movie), and her favorite stars Annette Haven, John Holmes and Sharon Thorpe. She rambles on about Haven over and over but only later in the compilation do we get to actually see a very young Annette in a cutting-room-floor worthy three-way segment.Man of her dreams Holmes shows up to end the film in what may or may not be newly shot footage - routinely humping Iris and ""THE END"" mercifully superimposed on screen arbitrarily after he unloads his wadd on her belly. The main discussion of Thorpe accompanies a scene focusing on a different actress altogether.The endless clips are mainly orgies, for which the narrator reveals Tobalina's philosophy and in my mind his undoing, as she asserts ""Orgies are always a turn-on for audiences"". CT is fond of making claims with no research backing them up, and movie orgy sequences, especially his, are generally show-stoppers in the worst sense of that term: they cause the film to grind to a halt and are never as stimulating as a torrid pairing or three-way. Her narration is often beyond stupid, as in lines like: ""They love to perpetrate their love and passion"", referring to (another idiotic claim) adult film talent appearing on screen in an altruistic sense of wanting to please people, not for the money. This, like the usual tell-tale defensiveness of ""porn actors are not prostitutes"" (she even claims they are as good a set of actors as mainstream thespians) is tiresome b.s. propaganda similar to the still-in-circulation on video intros that cloak pornography under the ""free-speech activists"" umbrella. I'm waiting to hear what future president Rand Paul has to say on the subject, given his extreme libertarian views on most everything else.Among the random XXX scenes, culled from films like HER LAST FLING and THE ULTIMATE PLEASURE, is even a black-and-white 3-way loop featuring Joey Silvera and Leslie Bovee. One lengthy orgy sequence is defective, but Tobalina includes it anyway, having the narrator apologize a couple of times for the ""flare and glare"", even giving the blame to Iris who supposedly worked as camera operator (we see dumb shots of her standing behind a huge (Mitchell?) stationary camera with Fernando Fortes as focus puller), and when she is actually on screen victimized by said f&amp;g, carefully explaining that Tobalina on camera is not to fault because he had inherited the faulty camera settings from her. Hey CT, why not scour your vaults and replace the faulty footage with something else buddy?Which of course raises the question of our dear video distributors, in the last throes of reissuing vintage porn on DVD (let's ignore streaming for the moment) to a gullible but rapidly dwindling modern audience (myself especially included, since I am a prime customer). What are the criteria for rejecting some crappy old film (or defective one whose decent elements have been lost and only an inadequate print or VHS copy remains)?.Vinegar Syndrome which is inflicting the Tobalina oeuvre on both shills (see many of the IMDb reviews, excluding mine) and curiosity seekers is only the latest purveyor to pretty much ignore content quality, although they have been relatively scrupulous in terms of utilizing decent materials for video transfer - I'm talking here about issuing well-preserved versions of worthless junk.

Jos oisi valtaa...,1941,N/A,93 min,"Comedy, Musical",Yrjö Norta,"Lauri Kyöstilä, Jaakko Sola","Aku Korhonen, Sirkka Sipilä, Yrjö Tuominen","At the time of writing this, I have only seen four films by director Yrjö Norta (1904-1988). The comedies Asessorin naishuolet (1937) and Lapatossu (1937) didn't impress me much, while the drama Yövartija vain? (1940) is actually pretty alright. Jos oisi valtaa, the follow-up to the latter, is not exactly a masterpiece of cinema, but works fine as a silly little comedy.The story is a variation of the traditional rags-to-riches pattern: a poor but well-liked and jovial garbage paper collector Mikko Nousiainen (Aku Korhonen) stumbles upon a winning lottery ticket and becomes filthy rich. With his friend Riku (Lauri Kyöstilä), he purchases a nickel mine from a greedy industrialist Irvas (Yrjö Tuominen) and becomes attracted to Irvas' pretty daughter Aune (Sirkka Sipilä) who doesn't mind his affections at all. However, troubles are caused by the schemes of Irvas and his business partner Berg (Joel Rinne), as well as several romantic misunderstandings.Even though the movie is not really a genuine musical, the plot quickly becomes secondary to various musical numbers like songs, dances and even a puppet show. Luckily the score by Martti Similä sounds very nice and the opera singing and ballet dancing are entertaining in their own right, which is fortunate for the movie considering how much time they take from actually advancing the plot. Not that the story is too strong to begin with: the writing goes for the most obvious jokes and all the tensions between the characters soon fizzle into nothing without much effort. Being his usual lovable if not too handsome self, Aku Korhonen may not be the most convincing love interest for the cute Sirkka Sipilä, but who cares, unlikely romances are pretty much a staple of the genre anyway.Everything mentioned in the paragraph above is true until the very last scene that completely changes the sugary taste the movie had been leaving in the audience's mouth before. The melancholic twist can feel like a disappointing downer at first, but I think it ultimately raises the movie above run-of-the-mill musical nonsense, as much I like silly song-fests. In any case, despite Norta's direction coming across as a bit aimless at times, I enjoyed Jos oisi valtaa a lot, largely thanks to the charisma of Korhonen and the numerous musical scenes. In the end, the bittersweet tone earns the movie a place among my favourite Finnish films of the 1940s.",Finnish,Finland,N/A,4.7,43,tt0137042,N/A

The only saving grace to all that pain is that there is a hero and heroine in this story, and they might just take you with them if they can ever escape the awful things being done to them.

Via guerrilla style filmmaking, he's covering New Year's Eve celebrations and a New Year's Day parade, in what was likely a 2-day wonder.John Holmes is his technical assistant but only shows up briefly in the film -he had to hump and run.. Servicing John are several women, notably Abigail Clayton at a sloppy orgy. Keith hires a Black security guard to watch over his news van, but the guy poses as a big shot to facilitate some mixed-combo action with a blonde news groupie.Plenty of recognizable Frisco porn talent make the scene, including Miss frizzy hair herself, Toni Scott and the beautiful, unsung redhead Spring Finlay.

Unfortunately this one doesn't begin to deliver. The first section of the film is really weird, in a bad sense of the word - it looks as if the finished product turned out to be about 8 minutes too short, and therefore a mandatory prologue was squeezed out to make the film commercially viable. Both the ""prologue"" and the first sequence are shot practically without editing, and they destroy whatever mood the following pic might have striven to achieve. The rest is a somewhat confusing crime mystery without being particularly interesting. The action is accompanied bye a comical-illustrative bassoon theme, which really began to work on my nerves from the very beginning. The two leading ladies are very pretty, but they look so much alike it's sometimes difficult to understand who is doing what - especially since one of them is supposed to be a bit evil, the other not. There is the strange absence of direction or moody camera-work which one might expect from a film noir (presumably this film attempts at that), and which sometimes was well achieved by the Finnish filmmakers of that period. All in all, perhaps worthy a look, but very forgettable indeed.",Finnish,Finland,N/A,4.6,37,tt0137940,N/A

Meidän poikamme ilmassa - me maassa,1934,N/A,121 min,Drama,Erkki Karu,Erkki Karu,"Joel Rinne, Kaarlo Angerkoski, Fritz-Hugo Backman","1930's was an anxious decade in Europe, and this restlessness was felt in rather peaceful countries too, like in Finland. The Finnish film industry created a trilogy of films for the army, and this movie was the one that depicted the small and struggling Air Force of the nation.Unlike the more entertaining movie made fore the Navy, the film for the Air Force is actually rather violent and many scenes concern the civilian security in cities that are being bombed from air. It is rather interesting to see how a possible future war was going to be fought, and how the civilians should be protected. Many of these predictions and precautions also turned out to be correct.Many people will watch this for the aircraft, unfortunately the Finnish Air Force of 1934 was almost a generation away from that of the 1939. The only actual combat plane that is presented the film is Bristol Bulldog, and that type is the ""star"" of the movie. Another well featured plane is Blackburn Ripon float plane.I give this movie an extra star, or two, because it contains one of the ultra rare Finnish air combat scenes. For a modern viewer the movie itself could be rather tedious propaganda, or ""supervision"", but that tediousness is best explained in the context of its own time.",Finnish,Finland,N/A,4.4,45,tt0137944,N/A
Meidän poikamme merellä,1933,N/A,109 min,"Drama, Music",Erkki Karu,Erkki Karu,"Georg Malmstén, Kati Aspelin, Aku Käyhkö","'Our Boys At The Sea' is a typical militaristic propaganda film in the manner that was rather common in the 1930's everywhere in the world. Usually this type of movies have been deemed worthless, more or less for good, by modern viewers but if you're looking for an example of entertaining propaganda movie this film may be a good one. What is good in this particular film is mostly due to the merry and spirited singer Georg ""Jori"" Malmstén who plays the main role and performs his (still) rather popular songs. Malmstén actually steals the movie for himself from being just a propaganda film, and with his songs the whole movie becomes a rather good musical too.In many other propaganda films the nature of the enemy becomes very clear, but in 'Our Boys At The Sea' too direct references to any particular enemy are completely missing; the enemy doesn't need to be the Soviet Union this time. The film makes use of the small submarine flotilla Finland had before the second world war and it preserves a rare insight into the realm and submarine culture that has become completely forgotten after the war.Watch this for the songs, for the submarines and for Malmstén. Because the film has a lot of good kick I can't but give a high vale for it. Especially Malmstén's fans will rock it with this one and if you don't know anything about Malmstén before this may be a good spot to start with.",Finnish,Finland,N/A,4.3,41,tt0137945,N/A

I was a young girl at the time in between jobs and thats how I decided to go to work for Suomi Film on this project. The people in the film were very nice to work with but since it was wintertime, the studio, where it was filmed was freezing cold. I don't believe the place was heated at all. We all were cold, in particular the extras, as we had on summertime short sleeve knit shirts for our parts.Heikki Savolainen, one of the main characters in the film, saw how I was shaking from cold, and invited me to get warm by opening his warm wool jacket and wrapped his arms around me to get warm. It was heaven to share his body heat. He may have had some ulterior motives there as well, who knows, but I appreciated it nonetheless.I don't remember anything much about the storyline on this film. Only that it was fun to make. Lots of pauses and waiting for the studio lights to cool off so they won't explode from overheating. Lights were the ones that gave us warmth when turned on, even for short periods of time as it was. I believe the Suomi Filmi company was operating on very slim budgets those days, over half a century ago.I remember seen this film at the time, but did not recognize myself at all in it. My young friends did and I received lots of comments about been in this film. Now, however I'd love to to see it again after 55 years and would like to buy a copy of it, if possible, somehow, in CD / DVD. Please send Email to: fotovideo2@aol.com. Thanks.

Sexdance Fever,1984,N/A,N/A,Adult,Alex Robbins,Peter Gains,"Jesse Adams, Tara Aire, Toni Alessandrini","One of three porn versions of supremely silly - though fairly impossible to actively dislike - mainstream hit FLASHDANCE to come along in 1984 (the others being Ken Gibb's FLESHDANCE – hands down the best of the lot – and, at the other end of the quality spectrum, Eve Milan's FLASH PANTS !), this pretty much delivers the goods for true blue porn fans, mostly thanks to an attractive all star cast. Credited director is one ""Alex Robbins"", a thinly disguised masculine form of longtime helmer David Fleetwood's favored pseudonym ""Adele Robbins"". Grating synth soundtrack aside (a common gripe in both porn and mainstream scores at the time), production values are solid if not sumptuous. Plot has struggling designer Pamela Mann (billed as ""Pamela Anderson"") trying to get the attention of legit Hollywood studios while making ends meet as a seamstress at a down market strip joint. Juggling run-ins with tempestuous dancer Lupe LaCola (Toni Renee who went on to minor fame in straight to cable fare) and a budding relationship with the bar's choreographer (Eric Edwards), she ultimately makes good on her dream. Story stops and starts with regular intervals for decent if unspectacular sex. Mann and Edwards had already shown terrific chemistry in Hal Freeman's X-FACTOR and pretty much provide the hottest moments. Platinum blonde cult siren Desiree Lane (of DARK ANGEL fame) devours first Ron Jeremy then Herschel Savage in one of the more spirited runners-up and also assists in the films flat-out funniest bit involving a remote-controlled vibrating egg oddly prefiguring John Cameron Mitchell's justly celebrated SHORTBUS. Say no more? Tanya Lawson on the other hand is wasted even if she does share another tryst with then boyfriend Jeremy who, according to documentary PORN STAR, never really got over her. Tara Aire (BABE, and I don't mean the pig flick !) and Cara Lott (sole female star of Tom De Simone's BI-COASTAL) take on a very youthful Marc Wallice in the storage room. Too little-seen Diva (star of Frazer and Svetlana's SURRENDER IN PARADISE) is the pillow-breasted brunette with Jesse Adams.

Two Impossible Films,1995,N/A,28 min,Short,Mark Lewis,N/A,"Françoise Yip, Paul Cum, Alastair Bird, David Pan","Two Impossible Films is an art gallery ""conceptual"" film, consisting in two feature films but whose opening & closing credits only are actually shown. The first film is an adaptation of Marx's ""The Capital"" such as Eisenstein was planning to do it until he got the interdiction by Stalin. It starts a bit like ""Zabriskie Point"" (by Michaelangelo Antonioni), in a college classroom with a debate held between students. The second film, humbly called ""A History of Psychoanalysis"" is meant to talk about the missed encounter, in 1932, between Sigmund Freund and Samuel Goldwyn, who was planning to ask the Austrian physician to write a film about psychoanalysis. For both films, opening credits are displayed while the film starts (35 mm film, with a cast & extras & shootings on location), but once the name of the director has been displayed, the screen turns black and for a few seconds, white lines read ""story development"", ""emotional apex"", ""plot resolution"" until full end credits (with mostly imaginary names I guess) start to roll down for over 5 minutes, with all the legal mentions, logos and thanks at the end. By creating a frustration over two legendary projects that were never put to completion, Mark Lewis first pretends to watch cinema as an art form tightly tied to our recent history. An art form also subject to reinterpretations according to the links it has precisely developed with the philosophical pillars of our society (psychoanalysis, politics). The result is a strange, ironic, beautiful (even plastically speaking) experience for movie lovers who will understand the meaning of this high profile hoax, started in 1995 and that Lewis has kept on working on, titling the whole project ""cinema in parts""",English,Canada,N/A,7.7,9,tt0138151,N/A

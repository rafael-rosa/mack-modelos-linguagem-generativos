Expect discomfort and confusion, but prepare for scenes of sudden slow tension that lingers on-screen and off. If you dig films that take their time bringing you into a world and allowing you to take from it what you will, you'll probably dig this one. If you prefer things made clear, move along. If you're the type of person to ask ""What's going on? Why'd they do that?"", don't see this with a crowd.Having seen it twice within a 24-hour period, I must say it's worth a second viewing if not just to catch all the foreshadowing and better understand what the hell is going on. I'm not saying anything about the plot because I don't want to ruin or alter anyone's journey.Things I Like:1) The way it's entirely composed of long takes and tracking shots2) How every moment of every damn scene is screenshot-worthy3) Dat consistent rough-form cinematography4) Dat almost non-existent soundtrack5) The way it's almost subtly dark6) The telling of Icarus7) Dat endingFavorite Character:Lady Padmé. For the look of her (even when bare) and her words.Similar:1) Long Day's Journey Into Night (2018). For its slowness, story-telling, and cinematography.2) Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains (2019).

The company had found a niche with Peridex-a prescription mouthwash used to treat thrush in people suffering from HIV/AIDS. But despite selling to the LGBT community, P&amp;G had no language protecting these individuals within the company. Chanak, who'd become a vocal gay rights activist, wanted to change that. With years of work and help from a small but determined group of colleagues, in 1992, P&amp;G became one of the first Fortune 500 companies to add sexual orientation to its equal employment opportunity (EEO) statement of diversity. Twenty-five years later, that legacy lives on.

After a mishap, Sarah is instructed by her doctor to stay in bed. Begrudgingly she does. That is, until a strange older man moves in next door. A man with black teeth and an odd habit of sneaking into Sarah's yard to steal weeds. Emboldened by curiosity, Sarah sneaks into her neighbor's yard - only to be locked inside a greenhouse. After she breaks a glass pane to escape, she cuts herself and faints. Sarah wakes and learns the neighbor had treated her wound with a strange herbal ointment and brought her to the hospital. Eventually Sarah gets up the nerve to introduce herself to her next door neighbor. They form a fast friendship and, when Sarah sneaks a look into his picture scrapbook, she discovers an amazing secret. He's the same age in nearly every picture - pictures that span decades! Sarah discovers than her next door neighbor is over two thousand years old - a drifter with amazing stories and life experiences. But what is the secret behind his longevity and why did he enter her life when she is at her lowest point? When Sarah's husband goes away on an unexpected business trip, her ex boyfriend shows up at her door. Even though Sarah and her ex are now married to other people, in a moment of weakness they had a one-night stand several months ago.

So if anything it amps up the stakes... because a scary monster that just kills and eats you is kind of boring. That said. This was crap. It looked good and the acting was decent... the monster is a nasty piece of work... but the writing is just awful. Having not read the book I can't say who is to blame, but the dialogue is just juvenile. Even though brief it's certainly better than Header... but that's not saying much at all. Still, if this ever does get developed into a full length movie I'd be willing to give it a second look, but I'd keep my expectations VERY low.",English,United States,1 win & 1 nomination,6.2,80,tt2405564,N/A

Kassie in particular is afraid she won't make friends, especially since her school doesn't have a music program. Music and singing is one of her passions, one of the ways she stays connected to the memory of her musician mother. Kassie stumbles upon an injured and abandoned German Shepard, who, with Esther's help, nurses him back to health while hiding the fact of who they eventually name Scoot from their father, who they believe will not let them keep him. But upon finding out about him, Paul does allow them to keep Scoot, who Kassie considers her first real friend in Heber Valley. Kassie is eventually able to use music in the form of the children's choir at the local church to find her place in town. She and the other choir kids mobilize their talents to raise money for the Toys for Tots Christmas charity, donations which were in short supply due largely to the fact of there being no snow in a town that relies on winter tourists. As the donations, which are being kept in a locked glass box in the middle of bank, increase, Kassie and her friends are unaware of two things. First, the two security guards Paul just hired are really criminals who plan to rob the Toys for Tots donation box. And second, Scoot is really a Fort Collins, Colorado police dog named Jake who thwarted the two crooks' last robbery, who was left for dead by the two crooks when they had the opportunity for revenge, and who remembers well the two who tried to kill him.","English, French",United States,N/A,4.7,424,tt2406468,N/A

"I'm Fine, Thanks",2012,Not Rated,69 min,Documentary,Grant Peelle,N/A,"Adam Baker, Joe Commodore, Yvette Commodore","In a word, ""I'm Fine, Thanks"" is a movie about complacency, or why so many settle for mediocrity in their everyday life at the expense of a greater passion. It's a collection of stories on the choices we make and the paths we ultimately decide to follow. And - most importantly - whether or not that path is truly connected to who we are as individuals. First-time director and Wilmington native Grant Peelle narrates the film from the perspective of a fledgling filmmaker acting on his long-held passion to make movies. Together with four other crew members and a trusty van, Peelle takes the audience on a 42 day, 10,000 mile road trip to capture stories of complacency and triumph from all across the country. ""For 15 years I had placed my dreams on hold, choosing to create a 'responsible' life instead of chasing my dream to be a filmmaker. This movie is my stand against complacency. It is a dream come true,"" said Peelle. The film was financed through a record-setting fund raising campaign on Kickstarter, the popular crowd-funding platform. The crew raised $114,000 through the support of more than 4,400 backers - more than any documentary in Kickstarter history. The film opened to sold-out crowds in Portland, New York and Los Angeles in July and will begin appearing at film festivals internationally this fall. ""It was obvious from the start that this film carries a message that resonates with thousands and thousands of people,"" Peelle said. Told through a collection of intimate, hilarious and at-times heartbreaking stories from a cross section of America, I'm Fine, Thanks is a ""coming of age"" movie for the already ""of age."" It's a rally cry for personal empowerment and a wake-up call to anyone who is driving through life asleep at the wheel.",English,United States,N/A,7.6,90,tt2407730,N/A

Stackpole, Jordan Weisman",N/A,"According to the Mayan Calendar (and lots of tabloids), the world will end on December 21, 2012. It's part a 5,200 year cycle of death and rebirth that, in Shadowrun, actually charts the ebb and flow of magic from the Earth. So, on 12/21/12 magic will return, end this world, and wreak holy havoc while starting the next. Aboriginal cultures, who maintained their mystical traditions, are the first to feel the return of magic and use their newfound power to reshape the political, financial, and physical world around them. As the magic increases, Elf and Dwarf babies are born to very surprised parents who carry the right combination of long-dormant genes. But all of these events pale in comparison to the horror of ""goblinization"", which painfully reshapes the teenage bodies of those unlucky enough to carry dominant Ork or Troll genes. And then the first Great Dragon rises from its 5,200 yearlong hibernation and circles over Tokyo, signaling that the world has truly AWAKENED. Fast forward two generations, to a world transformed not only by the growth of magic but by the acceleration of cyber technology - a continual effort to improve upon the gifts that nature gave humanity; by the inevitable maturation of the World Wide Web into the Matrix - a network directly accessible by the human brain; and by the near elimination of governments as they are replaced megacorporations - monolithic entities who see only customers, not citizens. And moving through the dark shadows cast by the gleaming towers of the corps, are Shadowrunners - disposable assets and corporate pawns scratching out a living using a combination of technology, magic, and street smarts. Shadowrunners live between the cracks and operate outside the law, doing the dirty work that corporate wage-slaves won't soil their hands with and occasionally acting as the only protection the citizenry can turn to.

The main topics is every-day life of ordinary boys at the biggest quarter of post-socialistic blocks of flats - Petrzalka - and coming-out of one of them. The movie is very funny and quite realistic too. It describes real life-style of many young men from today's Petrzalka in the slang typical for this quarter (which makes it even more fun for Slovak native-speakers).

Comedienne Tracey Ullman plays Ethel Monticue, a woman who must decide between two suitors: the suave and worldly Bernard Clark (John Harding) or the clod Alfred (Kenny Ireland), sent off to London to learn how to become a gentleman. Unreal sequences, such as entering the chambers of the aristocratic elite through caverns, or a train that is really a horse stable, take the narrative of the film away from logic and into the fantasy of a child's imagination.

Liminal,2020,N/A,65 min,N/A,"Manuela De Laborde, Lav Diaz, Óscar Enríquez",Philippe Grandrieux,N/A,"A FICUNAM commission for four directors, Liminal seeks to play with poetic affinities between film and music. Moving across aesthetic and generational differences, the film-makers explore this relationship through four distinct stories as to context and imaginary. Within the category of world cinéma d'auteur, Philippe Grandrieux and Lav Diaz have much in common in terms of their affinities with radical cinematographic form: both are extremely inventive in their practical relationship between music and narration. With La lumière la lumière (Lights, lights...), the French artist and director evokes the obsessive relationship between two women whose existence is kept by a lugubrious voice and by Alan Vega's and Marx Hurtado's famous Saturn Drive Duplex. In The World is Cold, the Filipino director describes a young man's life and his musical dreams intertwined with images of an erratic, phantasmagoric future full of obstacles. Relying on an entirely different aesthetics, Manuela de Laborde and Óscar Enríquez, two young directors of Mexican descent, approach musical phenomena quite differently. Through chaotic sound textures, Manuela de Laborde takes us towards three radically distinct landscapes in her Azúcar y saliva y vapor/Sugar, saliva and steam where subtle and sensual musical textures interweave with a leitmotiv in the background. In Lady Lazaro, Óscar Enríquez employs opera singing both as a protagonist and as a supernatural means of spiritual healing for broken souls.","French, Tagalog, Spanish","Mexico, France, Philippines",N/A,5.8,25,tt14095498,N/A

Mamachas del ring,2009,Not Rated,75 min,Documentary,Betty M. Park,N/A,N/A,"Set in the heights of the Bolivian Andes, Mamachas del Ring is the story of Carmen Rosa the Champion, a cholita and wrestler who struggles to make it on her own in the male-dominated world of Bolivian professional wrestling. In 2004, Carmen Rosa was at the forefront of a Cholita wrestler revolution. Never before had Bolivia seen an indigenous woman take her petticoats and bowler hat into the ring, and the crowds couldn't get enough. Along with three other Cholitas, Carmen became an international star, and all four were anointed the Mamachas of the Ring. The film begins in 2006, shortly after their return from a star-making turn on Peruvian TV-but their rapid success has come at a price. Jealousy and envy begin to ripple throughout the wrestling community, and eventually they are black-listed from performing in Bolivia's main wrestling league by its notoriously egotistical league commissioner, Don Juan Mamani. Betrayed but not discouraged, the Mamachas take matters into their own hands. They pound the pavement organizing their own shows, contracting media appearances, and traveling for days to perform across Bolivia, often to paltry crowds who can barely afford to pay the entrance fee. They were the first indigenous women to wrestle; they were the revolutionary stars. Now they are the first women wrestlers to manage their own business and contracts, desperately hoping to regain their crowns. The pressures of daily living and gendered responsibilities begins to eat away at the foundation of the Mamachas, and Carmen Rosa increasingly shoulders more of the work burden. Her day job as a street vendor begins to suffer and her attention to her family dwindles, until one day her husband issues her a firm ultimatum: wrestling or your family.",Spanish,United States,N/A,7.5,24,tt1410206,N/A

But they are not the truth, which is why Tolle asks us to listen to the gaps in his words as well as to the words themselves. Do we know ourselves? Some of us think we do. But what we really mean, says Tolle, is ""I know a lot about myself."" We know facts, information; we know the contents of our minds. But that does not mean we know ourselves. Tolle's meditation on the truth brings up the subjects of psychoanalysis, celebrity, the ego, the symbol of the Christian cross, overeating and other things. But no things are his true subject.

The Swinging Genie,1973,X,57 min,"Adult, Fantasy",Duke Latifundia,Rafael Bordoni,"Keith Erickson, Mary Dunhill, Louise Martin","Most early '70s porn quickies tend to be slapdash, as is this one, but at least there's an attempt to have a script and try to create some amateur special effects for the semblance of a ""real"" movie. Not adding up to much it is an OK showcase for some pretty actresses.Wearing a hairpiece that looks like it was willed to him by Moe Howard (the leader of The Three Stooges), Keith Erickson toplines as Marsh, a ""swinging"" guy who talks in a very '60s hip manner, but comes off as having studied the movies of Bing Crosby to get that cool patter going. If Der Bingle had been allowed to talk on screen about pot and other drugs I'm sure he was exposed to, this dialog could have been delivered in the '30s.He gets to make wishes courtesy of a nondescript genie (non-actor in the role is terrible, reading his dialog from cue cards apparently on the floor, as he keeps looking down to see what to say), and of course he wishes for pretty girls to appear and have sex with him. The idiot writing a pointless blow-by-blow booklet description for the film to be included as an ""extra"" with the DVD claims the genie being male is evidence of homo-erotic subtext; hey, the genie conjures up WOMEN, you don't need a female genie in porn, clown, just because Barbara Eden once played one.Erickson wishes for a magic carpet ride and through the magic of no-budget filmmaking, a jump cut later he is back, dressed in Arab gear, scene carefully omitted.This nonsense is basically Keith talking as a mister motormouth, with XXX footage the key visual. White smoke covers the frame for ""magical"" transitions (it actually works at this level of Z movie), and a cute but ultra-cheap animated credits sequence sets the mood. Orgy involving lovely harem girls helps eat up much of the less-than-an-hour running time.Two competing video companies have reissued the film, using nearly the same materials. The Alpha Blue Archives version is slightly longer, but of inferior visual quality, evidently just a DVD created from a VHS in the usual blur-o-vision. The After Hours Cinema edition has the opening credits messed up but provides a sharper image.Unfortunately, the AHC honchos (quite proud of their preservation efforts, per a short documentary on same they included on one of their videos) have issued the GENIE in letter-box format, losing image at both the top and bottom of the screen. I can't believe so-called professionals don't understand the difference between 1.33/1, 1.66/1, 1.85/1 and 2.35/1, the main ratios used for real films over the years, and think they're doing the viewer a favor by imposing a roughly 1.78/1 or 1.85/1 image to everything. Even 8mm stag loops are issued by AHC in their crude 42nd St. Pete videos, trumpeted as ""first time in widescreen"", as if anybody ever shot ""widescreen"" in Super 8! It's all insulting marketing hype, on the level of spoon-feeding the contents, scene by scene, sex act by sex act, in condescending summaries. Porn fans back in the day were perfectly able to enjoy cinema without explanation or annotation, so I don't see why even a retarded generation of retro-fans needs such asinine instruction. I guess it keeps a few itinerant bloggers in pin money as self-appointed ""historians"" shilling for this or that video outfit.My favorite Annette Michael has little to do but show off her huge breasts and hump Erickson as a harem girl, accompanied by the beautiful Jill Sweete and in a not-well disguised dual role, Sandy Dempsey. Dempsey is cast in a lead role here as Joy, but to save a buck she is also a fantasy harem girl conjured up by the genie wearing a veil. Her butterfly tattoo gives away the game, and later she removes the veil to hump Erickson, and is merely wearing a different hairdo than her short-cropped styling as Joy.",English,United States,N/A,N/A,16,tt1410260,N/A

Killing Europe,2017,Unrated,111 min,Documentary,Michael Hansen,Michael Hansen,"David Coleman, Caroline Cox, Kent Ekeroth","The migrant crisis of 2015 has shattered a once idealistic view of Northern Europe. What followed were images that shocked Europe to its core. Nightly riots, attacks on the police and infrastructure, waves of arson and looting, death threats and terrorist attacks. These attacks struck at the very foundations of free and open societies that media had praised so highly in Northern Europe. The wake of this violence has exposed these once venerated European societies as nations that are politically and culturally polarized with deeply rooted social problems and growing tensions among entrenched and increasingly partisan groups. This is the story of a Danish expatriate and his quest to uncover the stories behind headlines and the growing issues within European society, challenging the viewer with a vision of a Europe undergoing drastic and far reaching changes. It deals with the very personal journey of a son of Denmark attempting to understand how and why the Europe he left 12 years before, has become a socially, culturally, and politically distorted version of itself.",English,United States,N/A,8.9,41,tt7547662,N/A

The Earl of Essex has established a rival network and is trying to oust Cecil as Elizabeth's spymaster. Essex is everything Cecil is not. Cecil is bent-backed and under five foot tall. Essex is an athlete and a war hero who flirts with the Queen. But the two men have known each other since childhood. And now they are locked in a battle that is part court theatrical but which is also a lethal spy war in which people die horrifically violent deaths. The stakes are huge. For the winner, untold power. For the loser a one-way trip to the scaffold. Cecil is also aware that the sun is setting on the reign of Elizabeth, who is in her sixties. He and Essex are not just battling for control of the Queen, but for control over who will be her successor. For the power to select the next King of England. Essex begins a spy war within the spy war by secretly approaching James VI of Scotland and striking a deal to put him on Elizabeth's throne when she has passed away. So Cecil must somehow oust Essex from Elizabeth's court without making an enemy of James who Cecil also wants to inherit the throne. This is a secret conflict, involving double agents, coded letters, treachery and treason. It is a world that Cecil proves to be an absolute master of.

Mainstream: How Hollywood Movies and the New York Media Are Promoting the Globalist Agenda,2017,N/A,208 min,Documentary,James Jaeger,James Jaeger,"Chuck Baldwin, Blonde, Sam Chew Jr.","MAINSTREAM traces Hollywood's origins from the early art-driven movie moguls to the profit-driven corporations of today. With the government-decreed divestiture of movie theaters in 1948, the Golden Age of Hollywood was destroyed. Along with this destruction of the ""studio system,"" movies became increasingly formulaic, exploitative, violent and produced by a small ""control group"" of insiders. Then, with the advent of TV and various influences from Europe, Hollywood movies descended into a morass of cultural Marxist-infested political correctness that gave birth to what we now know as the MAINSTREAM MEDIA. Governed by just 6 huge conglomerates, Hollywood movies and the New York-based media have become involved with hundreds of predatory, unethical and often times illegal business practices that result in discrimination against talents, crews, executives and whole populations. Worse, the movies and network news have become a tool of the Globalist Agenda, an agenda to outsource the U.S. manufacturing base in the name of ""free trade"" and destroy the American Middle Class in the name of ""stockholder value."" Liberal Hollywood has become one of the ""big bad"" corporations it endlessly dramatizes in its movies. And all this started as a consequence of government intervention into the right of the movie moguls to market their own movies in their own theaters.",English,United States,N/A,N/A,15,tt7550296,N/A

The Rakkasans were the invading force for both Middle Eastern Theater Wars where Korey and his unit were the tip of the spear, twice. This film investigates new and controversial techniques and methods for treating PTSD but more than that, it is a look into the lives of veterans in America today. Travelling 8,000 miles across the United States and back, Korey departs from his home in California, to check in with his former battle buddies across America, who served with him 15 years ago in the 187th Infantry Regiment of the 101st Airborne Air Assault Division. Along the way, he interviews psychologists and specialists from the National Center for PTSD in White River Junction, Vermont for a balanced understanding of the underlying symptoms and associated triggers for those with PTSD. This is an authentic portrayal of veterans today in America; their bitter combat to overcome drug addiction, criminal issues, and their individual struggles with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, disclosed by the vets who lived through it, and survived this growing epidemic. The number 22 is universally associated with 22 veterans per day committing suicide.

While on this same day indecisive and insecure Lauren has been promoted to full associate at Hampton and Associates by her demanding boss Ms. Hampton who Ned refers to as Cruella De Vil, Ned has not told Lauren in she accepting the marriage proposal that he, ill-equipped emotionally to handle the work, has quit his job as a public prosecutor, he arguably only going into the work to meet his now deceased father's expectations in following in his footsteps. In her focus on her own career especially with high maintenance Ms. Hampton, Lauren has never noticed Ned's dissatisfaction with his job. Within Ned's desire not to have a long engagement, Lauren wants to get married in ten days in her hometown of Darwin as she is able to negotiate the time off with Ms. Hampton. Upon Lauren and Ned's arrival in Darwin, they discover that six months ago her aborigine mother, Daffy Ford, left her father, Trevor Ford, for undisclosed reasons, her whereabouts unknown. With what little information they have on hand, Lauren and Ned leave teary-eyed Trevor in Darwin to lead the wedding planning as they try to find Daffy, Ned funneling his newfound energies into this task, those energies needed as Lauren, who really wants her mother at her wedding, is the one more apt to give up as they seemingly are going on a wild goose chase. As they trek through the expanses of Northern Australia, the leads point them in the direction of the Tiwi Islands, Daffy's homeland where she ran away from at age eighteen on what was to be her own wedding day to escape the arranged marriage - something she only ever talked about in veiled terms to Lauren - never to have returned. With this new information in the context of their situation, Lauren and Ned can't help but reflect on their own relationship in the count down to their own supposed wedding day.","English, Aboriginal, French",Australia,1 win & 7 nominations total,6.3,"2,445",tt7555072,N/A

What keeps Europe with its many nations and peoples together? Is there the ""typical European""? How did Europe shape our thinking, how did Europe enrich the world - and where did Europe plunge the world into disaster? Questions that Australian-born Sir Christopher Clark will engage in during his journey through the culture and history of Europe. Like no one else the renowned historian can take a curious and entertaining look at our continent ""from outside"" and in his personal presentations at Europe's most beautiful and fateful places sort out our confusingly diverse history.Europe is not a straight line from the ancient Greeks to the EU, but rather a story with many fractures. Where today 740 million people gather from different backgrounds and culture, there already was a hive of activity during early human history. And our world has been shaped by people from Europe, by the imagination of the Greeks and the organizational skills of the Romans, by Vikings and Celts, by dynasties like the Habsburgs and Tudors, by explorers like Marco Polo and Christopher Columbus, conquerors like Napoleon and of course the great geniuses like Michelangelo and da Vinci. Their historical influence is undisputed - but what so they say to us today? Ever and anon Clark directs us to look at the current legacy and scrutinises the patterns: Does Europe still see itself today as the Christian Occident? Are we actually children of democracy? And is Islam really part of it?What is at stake with Europe today? Christopher Clark repeatedly looks into this crucial question, marks the dividing aspects and sheds light on the courage and visions of those who, after centuries of violence, want to make Europe a peaceful place.",German,Germany,1 win,7.9,162,tt7555714,N/A

Saint Maud,2019,R,84 min,"Drama, Horror, Mystery",Rose Glass,Rose Glass,"Morfydd Clark, Caoilfhionn Dunne, Jennifer Ehle","There, but for the grace of God, goes Maud, a reclusive young nurse whose impressionable demeanor causes her to pursue a pious path of Christian devotion after an obscure trauma. Now charged with the hospice care of Amanda, a retired dancer ravaged by cancer, Maud's fervent faith quickly inspires an obsessive conviction that she must save her ward's soul from eternal damnation - whatever the cost. Making her feature-film debut, writer/director Rose Glass cannily lures the audience into this disturbed psyche, steadily setting up her veritable diary of a country nurse for an unnerving and ultimately shocking trajectory. Morfydd Clark (also at the Festival in The Personal History of David Copperfield) portrays the sanctimonious Maud with an intense stoicism that belies a disquieting vulnerability, as Maud desperately vies for absolution and solidarity from her embittered patient (an enthralling Jennifer Ehle, also at the Festival in Beneath the Blue Suburban Skies). Glass tenderly captures this relationship with an empathetic gaze that first assumes an ethereal, dreamlike atmosphere - but it isn't long before Maud's dogmatic candor incites an irreconcilable friction that spirals her mind into a suffocating confluence of creeping doubt and paranoia. As Glass tightens the screws on her misguided martyr, well-placed nods are made to religious horror forerunners like William Friedkin's The Exorcist, further contributing to the film's increasingly dread-filled malaise. And when this insidious fever climatically breaks, the consequences are devastating and terrifying in equal measure.","English, Welsh",United Kingdom,Nominated for 2 BAFTA 11 wins & 33 nominations total,6.6,"52,802",tt7557108,83

As formerly persecuted Christianity was adopted since Constantine the Great as state religion, the church was destined to be partner of the Byzantine empire -a different Greek church long before the theological schism- and heir of the West Roman, where it represented continuity under Germanic conquerors, who converted like Clovis at the start of the Frankish empire, with Charlemagne championing its imposition -by bloody submission of the pagan Saxons- as cultural glue. Soon followed crusades against Islam, which invaded Iberia in the 8th century, but largely was a source of enriching exchanges, even the conservation and development of Ancient and Byzantine inheritance with Oriental additions. However theological argumentation for revolts and the schisms of Protestantism since the Renaissance plunged the continent in a devastating series of -obviously politically manipulated- religious (civil) wars, only brought under some control in the Westphalian peace treaties of 1648, fruit of an unprecedented diplomatic effort and start of a process of separation of state and religion, part of the Enlightned model of personal liberty and peaceful coexistence.",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,12,tt7559378,N/A
